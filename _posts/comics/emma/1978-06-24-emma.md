She must have really liked this tee shirt as the word "PEANUTS" is almost washed out, she probably couldn't resist buying it as she was also called peanuts when she was young. Below is a photo taken maybe a year earlier with her chaperone Zena English, the tee shirt looks fairly new, she is also wearing her favourite Scorpio medallion mentioned below in Womans Own 14th June 1975.
