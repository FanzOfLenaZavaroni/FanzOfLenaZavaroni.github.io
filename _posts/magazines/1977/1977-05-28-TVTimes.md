**Front cover** and two page article inside to promote Lena's appearance on You're Never Too Old.

Lena reveals that she is now 4'10&quot; tall, gets £5 a week pocket money with a pound a week extra if she keeps off fatty foods like spaghetti and sweets.

She says that she hates arithmetic and ballet, and had a boyfriend recently whom she 'bonked' on the head. She also predicts that she'll get married when she is 26.

Also a small photo of Lena as an old lady on the listings page for the show.

**Reading Between The Lines**

**Control**

> Fact Lena was and had been a working child so it goes to show the control over her by those around her that she saw her income as pocket money.
