>The Carnival Princess's float, it makes sense that Lena was chosen to open the carnival as it was The Year of The Child. Mike and Bernie Winters attended as celebrity guests.
Bernie Winters mentioned to someone that the princess's dress was coming off, when they replied that it wasn't, he said "It will be later".

> Great photos thanks for sharing.
>
> Disapointing comment by Bernie Winters as I beleave the Carnival Princess was around 15 years old so a completely inappropriate comment considering her age, whether or not she heard it.
>
> I have no doubt Bernie Winters just thought he was being funny and had not consider the implications of his comment but the double play on the meaning (if we give him the benefit of the doubt that she would just be getting change) can not justify the comment when aimed at a minor.

> As the main meaning is that he will be having sex with her at some stage. So he may not have thought it but he is making a joke on statutory rape.
