The management at the Falkirk venue had heard what had happened the previous week at [New Brighton](/theatre/the%20lena%20zavaroni%20show/1982/09/19/the-lena-zavaroni-show.html) and would not allow Lena to perform and cancelled the show.

**Research is on going and hopefully I will be able to add more details**
