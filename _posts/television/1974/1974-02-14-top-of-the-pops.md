**Note:**
> There is some debate over if this is the recording of Lena Zavaroni as broadcast or if it is a camera rehearsal recording made prior to the live broadcast until the BBC use the footage in a Top Of The Pops retrospective and confirm one way or the other we will each have to decided for ourselves what we are seeing in the clip.
>
> Either way this is believed to be the earliest surviving clip of Lena performing (for a broadcaster).
>
> Added "for a broadcaster" because we don't know if her family have super 8 film recordings of Lena Zavaroni before she went on Opportunity Knocks.
