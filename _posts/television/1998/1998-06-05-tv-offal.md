## Child

> This joke actually shows that the views some fans have on how Lena Zavaroni was dressed younger than she was, was also notice by some in the world of show business.

## Crude
> While the Crudeness is deeply offensive, there may be a hard truth within it, as some may know Lena had issues when it came to sexual relationships and so this may be an attempt to open up the can of worms as to whether or not Lena had been sexually abused.
>
> Sadly I would not be surprised because as we all know she had to face most other types of abuse throughout her life.
