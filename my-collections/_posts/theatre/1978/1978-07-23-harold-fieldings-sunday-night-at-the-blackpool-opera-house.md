<span class="fb">**Victoria Paula Roberts** saw this with my nan. Remember being disappointed Lena never wore a dress because I seem to remember a green sparkly outfit, but I suppose she was 14 by then!</span>

**Fanz of Lena Zavaroni** I'm guessing the green outfit may have been this one. <br /><br />Thank you for sharing your memory of seeing Lena.</span>

<span class="fb">**Fanz of Lena Zavaroni** Wonderful that you got to see Lena that many times and glad you still got your memories of her.<br /><br />As with the passing of Lena all we have left to keep her alive is our memories and so long as one person remembers Lena then she can live on.</span>
