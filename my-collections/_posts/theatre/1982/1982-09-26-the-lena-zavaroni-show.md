The management at the Falkirk venue had heard what had happened the previous week at [New Brighton](/theatre/new%20brighton/1982/09/19/the-lena-zavaroni-show.html) and would not allow Lena to perform and cancelled the show.

### comment
> Pleased that the Falkirk management chose to prevent Lena from performing as it's not often that we see the health of Lena put first.
>
> Shamefully it should have been the Solomons and Victor Zavaroni not only as the director of Lena Zavaroni PLC but more as a caring parent that should have cancelled the show.
>
> Makes me wonder if Lena's managerment still claimed the revenue from the show as they had not cancelled it. I would not be surprised.
