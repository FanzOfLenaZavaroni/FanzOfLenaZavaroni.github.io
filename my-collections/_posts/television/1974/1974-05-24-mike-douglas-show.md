### The Stillman Diet
> The Stillman Diet is a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that was created in 1967 by physician Irwin Maxwell Stillman (1896â€“1975).

She eventually abandoned the Stillman Diet and limited her caloric intake extremely. By September 1975, Karen's weight dropped to 91 pounds.[3] In 1983 she died of complications related to anorexia nervosa.
