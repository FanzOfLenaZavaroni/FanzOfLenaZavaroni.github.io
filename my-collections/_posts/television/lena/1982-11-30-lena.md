Tonight's special guests on Lena are Frankie Howerd and The Nolans.

**Note:** Series 3 was split with the first 3 episodes taking place in the BBC's Spring, Summer Season and the final 3 episodes taking place in the BBC's Autumn, Winter Season.

The reason for the split was because of the broadcasting of World Cup 82 and Wimbledon 82.

The complete series was recorded in one block during the Spring, Summer Season which would turn out to be lucky for the BBC as if they had delayed the recording of the last 3 episodes then due to Lena's health they would not have got the last 3 episodes.
