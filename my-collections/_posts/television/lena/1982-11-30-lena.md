Tonight's special guests on Lena are Frankie Howerd and The Nolans.

**Note:** Sereis 3 was split with the first 3 epsiodes taking place in the BBC's Spring, Summer Season and the final 3 episodes taking place in the BBC's Autumn, Winter Season.

The reseason for the split-in-two was because of the broadcasting of The World Cup 1982 and Wimbledon 82.

The complete series was recorded during the Spring, Summer Season which would turn out to be lucky for the BBC that they recorded it that way as if they had delayed the recording of the last 3 epiosdes then due to Lena's health they would not have got the last 3 episodes.
