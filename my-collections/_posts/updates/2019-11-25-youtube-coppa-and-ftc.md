**YouTube, COPPA and FTC**
For details on COPPA and FTC search YouTube and/or your preferred search engine just note there will be a lot of scaremongering.

Only reason I brought it up is because to fix the issues on my channel I could have just done what many users may do which is to mark their videos as made for Kids (yuck, I so hate hate the word kids when we mean children) but I'm not going to lie just to make YouTube and the FTC happy.

Just because children may be attracted to the videos does not make that my intent. I don't see how the FTC would be able to fine a non-US citizen but I'm not willing to be the test case so instead of lying and saying my videos are made for kids (Kids is the term being used by YouTube) when that is not my intent and if you know your facts about Lena Zavaroni then you will know that child under the age of 12 were not allowed into the recordings of "Lena Zavaroni and Music", while I am unable to confirm it I would imagine the same was true of her later TV series "Lena" as well. which could prove that content was not made for children.

I'm not willing to go through each video and make the impossible choice of what is "made for kids" as defined by YouTube and the FTC as what they consider suitable for kids is going to be much broader then my definition.

Until we see what happens in 2020 I have switch all my videos from public to unlisted which means that any links visitors have will still work and any embeds of my YouTube Videos on this Fan site will still work but visiting my YouTube channel will not let you see any videos.

I have also hidden likes, saved playlists and Subscriptions to protect other YouTube channels.

Any issues visitors have should be taken up with YouTube and the FTC.

NOTE: For anyone that visits any of my other Fanz of.. channels on YouTube you will not even be able to view the videos via a link as I have switch them from public to private, sorry! take it up with YouTube, the FTC and if your not a US Citizen then take it up with your government for letting another country restrict your freedom.

First Facebook, now YouTube how much longer before it becomes impossible to keep Lena Zavaroni, her music and her story alive.

NOTE: While users on YouTube are currently the ones making a big noise about this. You should realise that COPPA and the FTC will impact on all websites based in the USA.

If anybody knows of a video service outside of the USA please let me know.

Don't get me wrong I'm all for child protection but it's YouTube not it's users that are tracking content they should not be tracking, something that is outside of it's users control.

The one thing I have learn is that the term "Parental Responsibility" is now a oxymoron :-(

> **Robert Campbell Stonebanks:** YouTube proved they lied about the platform not being for children when they brought out the YouTube Kids App (I so hate the term Kids when we mean children).
>
> YouTube now has a Children's app. Why! not give creators the option to only show videos on YouTube or on the YouTube Kids App with only videos marked by the creators as child-friendly showing up on the Kids App and only so-called non-child-friendly videos showing up on YouTube that way we will all know that YouTube is only for over 13s and parents should not let children under that age on YouTube but can let young children view YouTube Kids.
>
> That will mean content creators that make content for a mature audience that may contain child-friendly content can still do so without having to lose out financially but that content will not be available on YouTube for Kids.
>
> Put simply breakup YouTube into YouTube13+ and YouTubeKids (Yuck) and let creators select via a simple option if a video should be on YouTube13+ or YouTubeKids a simple control that will protect children but also protect content creation.
>
> Then the FTC can go after the parents of under 13s that let them watch videos on YouTube13+
>
> Put parental responsibility back where it belongs in the hands of the parents(/guardians), Why have we let parental responsibility die?
>
> Edit: Just a thought but as you are meant to be over 13 to join YouTube is it not by definition all video content is only for over 13s and so by clicking to say your content is made for kids showing you are breaking YouTubes terms by making content for an audience that should not exist?
