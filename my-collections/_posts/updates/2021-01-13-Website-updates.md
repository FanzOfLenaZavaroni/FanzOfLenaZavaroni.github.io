### Front Matter
> I have started to update the Front Matter and how it is managed by my installation of Jekyll for you the visitors it means how the content on the homepage, Categories page is display this is in the hope I can provide details in the links that is more valid than was previously the case.
>
> While the updates take place some of the links will only have the main title showing, which will still take you to the related content, no content has been removed it just that until I add the related Front Matter for each of the pages they will not have the details just the main title showing.
>
> Thanks for your understanding and over time as each page gets it's Front Matter sorted out then the homepage, Categories page will automatically add the details for each page.
