### Celebrity Guests That Attended The Carnival
<table>
<tr><th style="width:160px; vertical-align:top;">Singer</th><td>Lena Zavaroni declared the Carnival open, then stayed for a short time to meet her fans and members of the public.</td></tr>
<tr><th style="width:160px; vertical-align:top;">Actors:</th><td>Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett as Steptoe and Son.</td></tr>
<tr><th style="width:160px; vertical-align:top;">Comedy Double Act:</th><td>Mike &amp; Bernie Winters.</td></tr>
<tr><th style="width:160px; vertical-align:top;">Disappointing:</th><td>Bernie Winters mentioned to someone that the princess’s dress was coming off, when they replied that it wasn’t, he said “It will be later”.</td></tr>
<tr><th style="width:160px; vertical-align:top;">Robcamstone:</th><td>I beleave the Carnival Princess was around 15 years old so a completely inappropriate comment considering her age, whether or not she heard it.
<br /><br />
I have no doubt Bernie Winters just thought he was being funny and had not consider the implications of his comment but the double play on the meaning (if we give him the benefit of the doubt that she would just be getting change) can not justify the comment when aimed at a minor.
<br /><br />
As the main meaning is that he will be having sex with her at some stage. So he may not have thought it but he is making a joke on statutory rape.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Note:</th><td>There may well have been other Celebrity Guests that I am currently unaware of that attended the carnival.</td></tr>
