> An inquest into the death of former child sensation Lena Zavaroni was told about the final weeks of her life today. A surgeon who treated her told how she was planning a return to the stage after an operation to help her combat anorexia but she weighed only three and a half stone and succumbed to a chest infection soon afterwards. The coroner decided that she died from natural causes.
