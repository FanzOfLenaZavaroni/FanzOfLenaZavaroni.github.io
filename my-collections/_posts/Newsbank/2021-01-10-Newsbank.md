### Spotlight: Like Lena Zavaroni's life, Stax was a tale of triumph & tragedy

### Readers comments
> Readers have not let the Herald get away with their fictional story which is what the above article is.
>
> If you go and read the comments left by readers you will see that they are willing to call the Newapaper out for this work of fiction.
>
> The fact that readers commented gives me hope for the fact that Lena Zavaroni's large body of work will live on and that someday the truth will become known.
