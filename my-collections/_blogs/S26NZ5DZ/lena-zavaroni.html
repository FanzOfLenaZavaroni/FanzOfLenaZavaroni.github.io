	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I finished reading Martin Shipton’s book about George Thomas, 
‘Political Chameleon’, a few weeks ago. Shipton was given a hard time in
 an interview on a Welsh radio programme for being so rude about Thomas 
in his book, although Shipton could actually have been a great deal 
ruder and really rather restrained himself.</p>
<p>George Thomas was the Labour MP for Cardiff West, 1945-83, Secretary 
of State for Wales, 1968-70 and Speaker of the Commons, 1976-83. In 1983
 Thatcher gave him an hereditary peerage and he became the 1st Viscount 
Tonypandy. Because George Thomas never married or had children, there 
wasn’t much point to that particular honour and the title died with him 
in 1997. Thomas was well known for his Methodism. The Methodist Church 
was a very powerful institution in Wales during George Thomas’s younger 
years and his position as a lay preacher and a big name in the Methodist
 Church&nbsp; – he became Vice-President of the Methodist Conference in 
1959 – gave him great kudos and influence. During the 1950s/60s, Thomas 
preached in nearly every city in Britain. In 1959 he went on a preaching
 tour of the US and took a stand against separate churches in Georgia. A
 black Church Minister stated that Thomas’s ‘face is white, but his 
heart is as black as ours’ – it is said that Thomas ‘never forgot’ this 
tribute.</p>
<p>Whilst George Thomas was Speaker, commentators outside of Wales often
 framed him as a national treasure. There were plenty of references to 
his Welshness – his accent was very obvious when he was calling for 
order in the Commons – and people waxed lyrical about this enthusiastic 
Methodist lay preacher who loved his mam and the Royal Family. As indeed
 did Jimmy Savile. Friendships across the political divide are common in
 Parliament, but George Thomas certainly pushed the boat out with regard
 to this – he was a big mate of Thatcher, who was perceived by many to 
have wrecked Wales to such an extent that it still hasn’t recovered. 
Thatcher discusses George Thomas in her book ‘The Downing Street Years’ –
 she heaps praise on him and explains that the basis of their friendship
 was their Methodism. (Thatcher occupied a curious position in the Tory 
Party in that she had been brought up as a Methodist and frequently made
 reference to this, yet the Tory Party was firmly situated within the 
Church of England and Thatcher seems to have felt obliged to move 
towards the Church of England. Not that she liked them very much – there
 was that comment that she made about the Bishops being ‘cuckoos in the 
nest’ because some of them showed a dangerous degree of tolerance and 
concern, she virtually denounced the World Council of Churches as a 
bunch of Communists in the pay of the Kremlin and then there was that 
dust-up with the Archbishop of Canterbury because he preferred to 
deliver a service emphasising peace and reconciliation after the 
Falklands conflict rather than go goosestepping through London as part 
of a ‘victory parade’.)</p>
<p>In the Labour Party in Wales however George Thomas was a very 
divisive figure and was actively hated in many quarters. He had always 
really riled Plaid and many Welsh speakers because he was extremely 
hostile to the Welsh language and had a problem with people who dared to
 speak it and ensure that their children could as well, but Thomas also 
became a substantial embarrassment and a difficulty for the Labour 
Party. He was completely opposed to devolution and although many other 
people in the Welsh Labour Party for many years were as well, Thomas 
remained rabidly anti-devolution after it had become Labour Party 
policy. His toadying to the British establishment and the Royal Family 
was so great that it became a national joke, even at a time when most of
 the population didn’t advocate dropping a bomb on the House of Lords 
and were very supportive of the Royal Family, consuming acres of vacuous
 newsprint about them.</p>
<p>Until quite recently, George Thomas was just another dead man who had
 once been an important figure in the Labour Party, but over the past 
few years he has become so notorious that a group of people in south 
Wales are campaigning to rename the Lord Tonypandy pub on the grounds 
that Wales would rather forget that this man ever existed. The source of
 the distress is that it has become clear that George Thomas was a 
paedophile. Not someone who had sex with his girlfriend when she was a 
few days short of her sixteenth birthday and he was just about 18, but 
an all out no holds barred child molester. The most serious complaint 
involved the rape of a nine year old boy, but there were numerous 
complaints over many years. In the way in which was obviously routine 
until very recently in cases of politicians sexually assaulting 
children, the complainants were ignored or silenced.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life people felt able to make noises 
indicating that George Thomas was gay, that nobody had a problem with 
this but that his position in the Methodist Church and the era in which 
he grew up dictated that it really did have to be kept quiet. However 
since George Thomas’s fall from grace numerous people have admitted that
 he was a vile, intimidating git who shamelessly used his position and 
friendships with powerful people – including members of the Royal Family
 – to achieve his own ends. Furthermore, just about everyone in south 
Wales politics – and further afield as well – knew about this. Something
 similar happened after Ron Davies was caught with his trousers down – 
or indeed off – on Clapham Common with Boogie. People came crawling out 
of the woodwork from every direction maintaining that Ron Davies was a 
complete bastard who treated people appallingly and that they’d always 
hated him. It was stressed that people had kept quiet because they were 
‘loyal’. Loyalty is a quality that I very much admire and I don’t think 
that there is nearly enough of it about. However, if someone is serially
 sexually assaulting other people – yet alone children or teenagers – 
and then committing even more serious crimes in order to silence their 
victims, loyalty is sorely misplaced.</p>
<p>Note to the Mafia of Drips: when a sex offender tells you to keep 
quiet about their offences, you DO NOT do it. OK 
Lesley/Rhodri/Jane/Drakeford/Julie? You absolutely stand up to them no 
matter what they do and you continue to stand up to them in every way 
possible YOU FUCKING IDIOTS. You do not ‘shut your mouth about DA’, you 
do not ‘go away from here and forget about everything that you have 
seen’. If Brown and me could withstand the pressure, what exactly was 
wrong with you? Ooh, I forgot – Brown and me were 21 and didn’t have our
 noses deep into the Trough of Plenty or entertain delusions that we 
were suitable people to run a country.</p>
<p>The methods used by George Thomas to silence victims and witnesses 
were certainly very similar to the methods that I knew to have been 
employed by Dafydd and the paedophiles’ friends in north Wales. George 
Thomas’s friend Leo Abse, an aggressively unpleasant lawyer who was 
Labour MP for Pontypool and then Torfaen, 1958-87, proved most useful. 
Abse himself talked about ‘homosexual partners’ of Thomas blackmailing 
him – it seems to have been the case that these were people who had been
 abused by Thomas who had complained and had either been bribed or 
threatened into going away by Abse. Abse was known to have been involved
 in paying one person to begin a new life in Australia and he also 
boasted that he told a ‘criminal’ who was making allegations against 
Thomas to leave Cardiff or he’d have him imprisoned for 10 years. The 
criminal left town and didn’t reappear. Such stories have a familiar 
ring to them – I knew young people in north Wales who were packed off 
abroad after discovering rather more than some wanted them to (see post ‘
 Just A Language Divide?’). As for the criminal who left town – whenever
 I made a complaint about the paedophiles’ friends it was stressed that I
 was a criminal. I did have a conviction – for staring at one of the 
paedophiles’ friends in Safeways – and had any of their many attempts to
 frame me for serious offences actually worked, I too would have been in
 prison for 10 years….</p>
<p>Then of course there was the South Wales Police to whom complaints 
were being made about George Thomas – but who did not act on the 
complaints, no matter how serious they were. There were also the railway
 companies who knew that George Thomas was indecently assaulting boys on
 his regular journeys between Wales and London – but no action.</p>
<p>As well as the many people in political life who knew that George 
Thomas was sexually assaulting minors, another group of people knew as 
well – the Top Doctors. Leo Abse, who protected Thomas for years, came 
from a legal family with members who were also psychoanalysts and his 
brother Danny was a Top Doctor – as well as a well known poet – who had 
trained at the Welsh National School of Medicine, Westminster Hospital 
Medical School and King’s College, London.</p>
<p>In his book Martin Shipton explains how Leo Abse correlated Thomas’s 
periods of illness with the times that Thomas feared being exposed. At 6
 am one morning in 1984, Leo Abse received a phone call from George 
Thomas who was in hospital. Thomas was in a dreadful state – it seems 
that Thomas was actually hospitalised as a result of contracting an STD 
and really thought that the game was up. It was Abse who negotiated the 
issuing of a public statement that Thomas had ‘waterworks trouble’ – 
very common in men of his age – and the ruse worked. Of course the Top 
Doctors will have known the reason why Thomas was in hospital and many 
other people in the hospital will have known as well. The Top Doctors 
have no trouble at all telling bare faced lies when high profile people 
are receiving treatment for conditions which would be career-death or 
cause massive embarrassment/scandal if the truth wee to be revealed. I 
do not think for one minute that the Top Doctors should disclose 
confidential details regarding their patients, but assistance from the 
Top Doctors comes at a high price – they’ll happily grovel to those 
patients and reassure them that they’ll handle everything, but those 
patients know damn well that they really mustn’t piss the Top Doctors 
off at any price.</p>
<p>Whilst I worked at St George’s one of the biggest names in light 
entertainment was a private patient of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain in
 the Obs and Gynae Dept where I was working. I don’t think that she had a
 clue as to the wrongdoing and chaos that prevailed in that dept, but 
she was definitely useful for providing a bit of PR which went a long 
way to ensuring that most scandals occurring in that hospital did not 
hit the media. Even when Chamberlain put his name to a paper based upon a
 huge research fraud and his colleague and co-author Malcolm Pearce was 
sacked and struck off, Chamberlain wasn’t (see post ‘I Don’t Believe 
It!’). Chamberlain had a more powerful network than Pearce, but I 
suspect that his friendship with the celeb also helped deflect the crap 
from the media hitting him personally. Whilst I worked in London medical
 schools I was also provided with details concerning a gynaecological 
condition affecting a member of the Royal Family at which the Top 
Doctors were having a good laugh. I mentioned this to Brown as an 
example of how no-one at all was safe from a knife in the back from the 
Top Doctors and Brown commented that this Royal personage had probably 
dared to change doctors, so that was the end of any confidentiality and 
respect afforded to her.</p>
<p>The celebs whom depend upon the Top Doctors’ silence usually trip 
over themselves to support Top Doctors’ balls, charity functions etc.</p>
<p>So I was interested to discover that George Thomas went in for 
supporting medical charities in a big way. The City Hospice in South 
Wales was originally known as the George Thomas Trust – it found that a 
change of name was necessary after people finally began admitting 
publicly what George Thomas actually did in his spare time. Dr Elinor 
Kapp, a retired child psychiatrist who worked for many years in Gwent 
and Powys, has been a member of the Board of the Hospice and a volunteer
 there since it’s foundation. Elinor’s husband was Prof Kenneth 
Rawnsley, Professor of Psychological Medicine at Cardiff, 1964-85 and 
President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1981-84. Rawnsley 
personally knew Dafydd and the paedophiles’ friends in north Wales and 
spent decades concealing their wrongdoing (see post ‘The Discovery Of A 
Whole New Galaxy…). Rawnsley will have known that Thomas was molesting 
children.</p>
<p>I note that George Thomas’s STD crisis and the associated fear that 
the gaffe would be blown occurred in 1984 – which was the year when 
threats from Dr DGE Wood and demands that I withdraw my complaint and 
keep quiet about Gwynne the lobotomist began raining down on my head 
like there was no tomorrow. Dafydd, Dr Tony Francis (Dr X) and the 
paedophiles’ friends in north Wales undoubtedly knew about George 
Thomas’s sex offending – they will have known via their mate and 
colleague Kenneth Rawnsley as well as through the many other connections
 detailed on this blog. Dafydd and many of his associates were involved 
with the Methodist Church (see posts ‘A Serious Moral Collapse’ and 
‘Ain’t Nothing Clean – Not Even The Welsh Calvinistic Methodists’) and 
when the former North Wales Police Superintendent Gordon Anglesea died 
in prison after being convicted of historical sex offences against 
children in care in north Wales, the Methodist Church as well as the 
Police Federation turned out in force at his funeral to give him a good 
send off.</p>
<p>George Thomas was a member of another powerful group of people who 
played a major role in concealing the wrongdoing of the paedophiles and 
their friends in north Wales – the Freemasons. Thomas was initiated into
 Sapphire Lodge at Penarth in 1944, whilst he was a school teacher 
living in Tonypandy. He was also a member of Cambrensis Lodge at Cardiff
 between 1950-53. Although Thomas resigned from Sapphire Lodge in 1965, 
Thomas continued to have a very close relationship with the Masons.</p>
<p>One of Thomas’s close friends was&nbsp; Lt Col Arthur Lennox of 
Cardiff, who was the Grand Treasurer of the Freemasons and who organised
 a big festival in south Wales in 1968. A letter from Lennox enclosing 
confidential Masonic information was sent to Thomas three years after 
George Thomas had left the Masons – Lennox requested that Thomas destroy
 the minutes of a meeting.</p>
<p>In 1984, when Thomas was in the Lords, Thomas received a reference 
request from Roger Clarke, Secretary of the Clive Freemasons Lodge in 
Cardiff, in respect of an application to join the Masons from Raj 
Aggarwal, who later became Consul for India in Wales. Raj had met Thomas
 through the Asian Society of Wales.</p>
<p>Raj is a man with so many talents and connections that there is not 
the scope to detail them all here, so I’ll just mention the highlights. 
Raj is a pharmacist who studied at the Welsh School of Pharmacy at 
Cardiff University, 1969-72. He worked for Boots plc in south Wales and 
then in London.&nbsp; Raj is a member of the Council for Cardiff 
University, a member of the Board of the Wales Millennium Centre, the 
Board of the National Pharmacy Association, the Board of Cardiff 
Business School and the Board of the Welsh International Business 
Council. Raj is Chair of Community Pharmacy Wales, a member of the 
Cardiff and County Club, Radyr Golf Club and the Vale of Glamorgan Golf 
Club. Raj has worked as the health correspondent for the Western Mail 
and as a Welsh Gov’t advisor, serving on Health and Pharmacy Committees.</p>
<p>Raj has been – and might still be – the Deputy Lieutenant of South Glamorgan. He boasts of a friendship with Prince Charles.</p>
<p>Most interestingly from my perspective, Raj is a Trustee and was/is 
Chair of the Kidney Wales Foundation and Donate Wales – George Thomas 
was also involved with Kidney Foundation Wales. The Kidney Wales 
Foundation evolved from the organisation established by Top Doctor 
William Asscher when he was Professor of Medicine at Cardiff. Asscher 
moved to London and became the Dean and then Principal of St George’s 
Hospital Medical School. He presided over that institution when there 
was major research fraud occurring (see post ‘I Don’t Believe It!’) and 
whilst the institution concealed organised child abuse and serious crime
 in north Wales as well as in London (see post ‘Some Very Eminent 
Psychiatrists From London’) and serious drugs offences (see post ‘A 
Galaxy Of Talent’). The wrongdoing at St George’s was obvious to anyone 
working within the institution, Asscher undoubtedly knew what was going 
on. Although Asscher spent the last part of his career in London, he 
continued to keep a home in south Wales and returned there after he 
retired. The crooks who ran Gwynedd Health Authority had a particularly 
high opinion of William Asscher and remained forever grateful to him 
because he secured the kidney unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd.</p>
<p>Asscher spent many years as a Top Doctor in Cardiff – he will have 
known about George Thomas and all the senior figures in politics who 
would do anything to keep Thomas’s activities quiet. Including giving 
the NHS lots and lots of money and never taking any action against Top 
Doctors, no matter how dreadfully they are conducting themselves – 
particularly if one of the Top Doctors who is the subject of much 
complaint is running the paedophile ring which is supplying the fresh 
meat to the politicians…</p>
<p>What a convenient arrangement all around!</p>
<p>William Asscher took up his appointment at St George’s in 1988 – the 
year after Dafydd and the paedophiles’ friends put me on a train to 
London and ordered me never to set foot in north Wales again. When I 
applied for a job as a research assistant at St George’s in the spring 
of 1989, I was told that I had not got the job. I then received a 
telephone call from St George’s telling me that so many good candidates 
had applied that a special post had been created for me should I wish to
 take it up. Obviously I thought that this offer was too good to be 
missed – but I was unaware that one of Dafydd’s mates was running the 
place and that the purpose of that job offer was to wreck my career and 
health.</p>
<p>William Asscher retired in 1996 – the year that the Waterhouse Inquiry opened.</p>
<p>In 1983 Ron Davies had been elected as the Labour MP for Caerphilly. 
The Ron whom everybody loathed and whom it was later admitted had 
interesting sexual tastes. In 1993 – after my career had been destroyed,
 after my friends who knew what had happened to me in north Wales had 
been found dead or had been hounded out of their jobs – Ron was 
appointed Shadow Secretary State of Wales by Labour leader John Smith. 
When Blair became PM in 1997, he appointed Ron as Secretary of State for
 Wales and was just gearing up to install Ron as Wales’s First Minister 
when Ron was caught with Boogie on Clapham Common…</p>
<p>I’m thinking of opening a book on who will be going to prison, for 
how long and in which prison they’ll serve their sentences. No doubt 
they will of course all retain the same Counsel – Cherie Booth QC! Who 
else would ever represent this lot now??? They won’t be able to rely on 
installing Huw Daniel as the presiding judge either, he’ll be in the 
dock along with the rest of them at this rate.</p>
<p>Do you perhaps wish that you hadn’t started all of this Wood?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 1985, Commander Michael Higham, the Grand Secretary of the 
United Grand Lodge of England – the most senior Mason in England and 
Wales – wrote to Thomas addressing him as ‘Brother Lord Tonypandy’. 
Which suggests that George Thomas was still considered a Mason in every 
way.</p>
<p>By June 1985, my problems with the paedophiles’ friends were 
escalating and I had begun to wonder what it was exactly that Wood and 
Tony Francis were hiding and were so frightened of me discovering.</p>
<p>Commander Michael Higham was Grand Secretary between 1980-89. In 
March 1998 BBC News reported that Higham was refusing to name Masons who
 had been involved with serious scandals in the British criminal justice
 system when he appeared before the Commons Home Affairs Select 
Committee, although the Lodge’s librarian and Communications Officer 
John Hamill had said that it was ‘probable’ that they would comply with 
the demands to name the people concerned because the Masons were a law 
abiding organisation who would not wish to be in contempt of Parliament.
 It was reported that Chris Mullin, the Chair of the Committee, was 
asking if there were any Masons who were part of the West Midlands 
Serious Crimes Squad, the unit which investigated the bombings for which
 the Birmingham Six were imprisoned or who were involved in the 
disciplinary hearing concerning the Deputy Chief Constable of Greater 
Manchester John Stalker, who was removed from the shoot to kill 
investigation in N Ireland.</p>
<p>Regular readers of this blog will have spotted a few familiar names 
in the preceding paragraph. Chris Mullin, the Labour MP for Sunderland 
at the time, fought a very brave battle on behalf of the Birmingham Six 
and played a key role in securing their release from prison. However 
Chris Mullin was not as helpful to the victims of the organised 
paedophile gangs which were operating in children’s homes in Sunderland 
as well as in other areas of the UK. In his capacity as a member and/or 
Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mullin recommended that 
police inquiries into child abuse should stop and that compensation to 
children who had been abused should only be paid if a criminal 
conviction had been secured (see post ‘Another Episode Of Friends’).</p>
<p>Once more we see that whereas various bodies and some individual MPs 
were prepared to fight for people being abused by the state, the two 
group of people who were not defended by any fighters for justice were 
kids in care who were being abused and mental health patients, many of 
whom were former kids in care who had been abused or had witnessed 
others being abused. The more that I think about this, the more that I 
am convinced that it is due to the involvement of the Top Doctors in 
organised child abuse. The nation is not so in awe of and frightened of 
paedophiliac gangs of social workers that no-one at all dares touch 
them. But people in Parliament are very well aware that if you piss the 
Top Doctors off and imprison a few of them you might not leave a 
hospital alive – should anyone doubt this, they need only to remember 
Michael Carr (see post ‘News From Sicily’). This is at the forefront of 
the mind of every middle-aged, boozing, not very fit politician with 
type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>John Stalker gained evidence of a shoot to kill policy in N Ireland 
as well as evidence of associated serious corruption and was removed 
from the N Ireland inquiry by James Anderton, the Chief Constable of 
Greater Manchester Police. However Greater Manchester Police was riddled
 with corruption and John Stalker had some very questionable associates 
himself. Stalker used to drop in to see folk in the North Wales Police 
whilst that force was colluding with Dafydd and the paedophile gang and 
also had links with numerous people in north west England, some of whom 
were known to be corrupt, some of whom were suspected to be corrupt and 
some who were just very good friends with people who were corrupt (see 
posts ‘Top Of The Cops’ and ‘A Stalker’s Network’). Elfed Roberts, the 
former corrupt Chair of the NW Wales NHS Trust and former senior police 
officer in north Wales (see post ‘Former NHS Managers Of Notoriety Now 
Keeping A Low(er) Profile’), was Facebook friends with a number of 
former officers in the Greater Manchester Police.</p>
<p>I have previously discussed how when Dr Dafydd Alun Jones used to 
make police statements or swear not very truthful affidavits about me, I
 and my friends used to howl with laughter at Dafydd’s overblown claims 
and curious turns of phrase and how when I read Stalker’s memoir 
(entitled most appropriately ‘Stalker’), I noticed an uncanny similarity
 between those crazed documents dictated by Dafydd and some of the 
expressions and style of writing used by Stalker. Dafydd and Stalker 
received very different types of education in different countries and 
even spoke different first languages – it is a little odd that they both
 used words and expressions that most of the rest of the English 
speaking world doesn’t. Stalker wrote that book at the time that Dafydd 
was busy compiling florid documents about me. Dafydd might be interested
 to know that a group of Hergest patients rolled around laughing on a 
bus in Gwynedd one day when someone spotted a notice that said ‘please 
mind your head when alighting’ –&nbsp; after observing that no-one 
actually would ever use such a word except for Dafydd, they speculated 
that perhaps he had found a new source of income, creating signs for the
 buses. Dafydd may have been a dangerous serious criminal, but he 
certainly provided entertainment over the course of many years. He has 
no idea how many catchphrases he inspired. I really would like to be a 
fly on the wall if he is ever arrested and questioned – he will be 
coming out with old favourites such as ‘don’t be so ridiculous’, ‘you 
don’t expect me to discuss this with a layperson like yourself do you?’,
 ‘come come, you can’t argue with a psychiatrist’ – the police will be 
pissing themselves laughing. ‘We’ve got a right one ‘ere Sarge, a sex 
offender posing as a Top Doctor’. Perhaps the police would like to send 
the recordings into ‘You’ve Been Framed’.</p>
<p>One thing that I am fairly certain that Stalker did discover whilst 
he was in N Ireland was what was going on in the Kincora Boy’s Home in 
Belfast and I strongly suspect that this was why he removed from the 
shoot to kill inquiry. Nobody in the British Gov’t was going to make 
much of a fuss if a policy of shoot to kill had been confirmed – it was 
hardly a secret – but there would have been a great deal of trouble 
indeed if the happenings at Kincora had been exposed, particularly as 
the members of Gov’t and High Society who were molesting those boys had 
links with the members of Gov’t and High Society who were busy molesting
 kids in other parts of the UK, including in north Wales.</p>
<p>It was confirmed that seven Masons were among the 97 strong West 
Midlands Serious Crime Squad. A Squad which undoubtedly had links to the
 British security services as well and probably contained people working
 for MI5 – one only has to look at who the Squad was fitting up, how 
much they were getting away with and the co-operation from other corrupt
 professional people which was forthcoming.</p>
<p>Higham was quoted by the BBC as saying of the Masons that ‘we have a 
few bad apples and we take charge of them but the rest are jolly decent 
chaps’. I am sure that not all Masons are child molesters or serious 
criminals, but the problem was that some of the bad apples were and the 
Masons didn’t put them out of action or indeed expose them.</p>
<p>Michael Higham received media coverage on other occasions as well. In
 May 1995, an article appeared in the Indie regarding a huge civil war 
within the Masons.&nbsp; The rank and file Masons had got together to 
try to stop the sale of the Royal Masonic Hospital in west London, which
 was planned by Higham and the Masons’ charity, the Grand Charity. Alan 
Lomas, the Governor of the Royal Masonic Hospital and a Freemason since 
1951, had issued a High Court writ against Higham and the Grand Charity,
 alleging that the Grand Lodge had been attempting to subvert running of
 the hospital since 1981 which had now culminated in Higham and the 
Grand Lodge’s plans to sell the hospital – Lomas alleged that some of 
the hospital governors were also in on the subversion and wanted to 
sell.</p>
<p>The Duke of Kent – who was the President of the hospital as well as 
England’s most senior Freemason – had commissioned a report from Touche 
Ross which had been published in 1990 and concluded that to remain 
viable the hospital would have to abandon its Masonic connections and 
become a private hospital. The Grand Lodge had responded by saying that 
in return for the substantial sums that the hospital was receiving from 
the Grand Charity, it would be required to adopt a new constitution 
which allowed the Duke to appoint a Chairman and four members of the 
Board. The proposal was rejected, the Duke resigned as President of the 
hospital and Prince Michael of Kent – the Provincial Grand Master for 
Middlesex – resigned as Vice-President. It was revealed that the 
Financial Director of the hospital was an undischarged bankrupt, that 
members of the senior management had been dismissed among allegations of
 misdemeanours and that the staff pension fund was millions of pounds 
‘adrift’.</p>
<p>The hospital Governors were led by Vice-Patron Douglas Brooks, who 
fought to keep the hospital open. The Charity Commission had called in 
Coopers and Lybrand to act as the receiver and sort out the cash 
problems.</p>
<p>In Dec 1994, after a mass vote, the Masons voted to close the Royal 
Masonic Hospital and to wind up the charity running it. Brooks abandoned
 his efforts to stop the sale which was when Lomas took up cudgels on 
behalf of the hospital charity and fellow Governors.</p>
<p>In July 1995 the Indie reported that the Commons Home Affairs Select 
Committee was to investigate the influence of Freemasonry in the police 
and judiciary and that Higham had offered his co-operation. The Chairman
 of the Committee at that time was Sir Ivan Lawrence QC, a Tory who in 
his day job as a barrister had defended some gangland criminals accused –
 and found guilty – of some particularly vicious murders. It was alleged
 that the Local Government Ombudsman had investigated Masonic corruption
 in previous years in the Borough Councils of Hackney and Lambeth. Frank
 Dobson – former Secretary of State for Health under Blair – managed to 
ignore a great deal of corruption relating to the abuse of children and 
mental health patients for many years, in his capacity as a Councillor 
in Camden, the MP for Holborn and St Pancras and as Health Secretary. 
Dobbo spent a number of years working as the Assistant Secretary to the 
Office of the Local Gov’t Ombudsman (see post ‘The Most Dangerous Man In
 The World – Part IV’).</p>
<p>Hackney and Lambeth were both Councils presiding over the serious 
abuse of children in their care – they also were both Councils which 
sent children in care on placement to children’s homes in north Wales.</p>
<p>The Local Government Ombudsman obviously didn’t make much headway. In
 1999 my friend’s baby died in the care of Musgrove Park Hospital when 
she should not have – my friend who knew what had happened to me at the 
hands of the north Wales mental health services and who had already been
 hounded out of her job at the Royal Television Society when she wanted 
to make a documentary about north Wales – and her partner was forced out
 of his job at the BBC in 1994. At the same time, the mental health 
services in north Wales were making strenuous efforts to imprison me 
once more on the basis of the perjury of their staff (see post ‘The Most
 Dangerous Man In The World – The Scottish Play’). I had been told that I
 was such a danger to the staff at the Hergest Unit that if I entered 
Ysbyty Gwynedd I would be arrested – presumably on the basis of yet more
 perjury – and I had been referred to the forensic psychiatry team. When
 I finally obtained the documentation relating to all this recently, I 
discovered that the forensic Angel Jackie Ehlen had taken the trouble to
 record that my friend’s baby had died. Jackie had been one of the 
Angels involved in the cover-up into the death of a psych patient in 
Ysbyty Gwynedd a few years previously which involved a number of people 
lying at the inquest (see post ‘Inside Information About A Hergest Unit 
Death’).</p>
<p>Diane Abbott used to work as the Press Officer and PR person for 
Lambeth Borough Council. She now represents the People of Hackney, as 
the Radio 4 satire ‘Dead Ringers’ enjoys reminding everyone.</p>
<p>The Indie report mentioned the Manor of St James, a Lodge famous for 
containing as members only former and serving officers in the ‘C’ 
division of the Met. Commander Higham explained that there was nothing 
sinister about Freemasonry, that it was all about benign socialising and
 that he was a member of the Naval Lodge, for retired and current Naval 
Officers. (A number of people who worked very hard to conceal the 
wrongdoing of Dafydd and the paedophiles had served in the Navy – 
including Jim Callaghan, Sir Alec Bingley and Professor Geoffrey 
Chamberlain, as of course had Gwynne the lobotomist himself.) It was 
emphasised that far from being an organisation full of police officers, 
many police officers joined the Masons in order to meet people who 
weren’t police officers. Perhaps people who were judges, Top Doctors, 
lawyers, senior figures in local gov’t etc who might find a friendship 
with a few police officers who were members of the same secret society 
dedicated to assisting each other, particularly in times of trouble, 
useful – such as at times when they had found themselves the subject of 
complaint after they had sexually assaulted children. The Indie 
mentioned a Chris Mullin MP who was on the Home Affairs Select Committee
 and who had campaigned for greater disclosure regarding Masonic 
membership after it was discovered that a number of the police and 
lawyers involved in the Birmingham Six case were Freemasons.</p>
<p>Chris – it’s more than twenty years later and Dafydd is still 
Chairing CAIS,&nbsp; the Top Doctors are writing lies on the medical 
notes which was the subject of my initial complaint about Gwynne the 
lobotomist in 1984 and kids in care are still being trafficked by 
organised gangs.</p>
<p>My how things haven’t changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Oct 1987 George Thomas accepted an invitation to a reception in 
London for the Cardiff Masonic Hall Company Ltd – the invitation 
mentioned ‘colleague Wyn Calvin’.</p>
<p>Wyn Calvin is a veteran Welsh entertainer and comedian who in 1991 
became the first Welshman to be elected to the Grand Order of the Water 
Rats as King Rat. Calvin has also been the Welsh Chairman of the Variety
 Club of Great Britain and was a founding member of the Noah’s Ark 
appeal which was launched in 2000 to lobby and raise money for the 
development of the Children’s Hospital for Wales aka the Children’s 
Hospital, Cardiff. The Children’s Hospital was opened in 2005 and is 
located on the site of the University Hospital at the Heath in Cardiff –
 the Children’s Hospital is managed by the Cardiff and Vale University 
Health Board.</p>
<p>There have been a series of scandals at the University Hospital at 
the Heath – one of the most high profile incidents of serious patient 
neglect was brought to public attention by Ann Clwyd, the Labour MP for 
Cynon Valley, who was horrified at the manner of her husband’s death in 
that hospital. The hospital robustly defended itself and Ann was 
denounced by the usual vested interests who were livid that she’d dared 
to level criticism at the national treasure which is the NHS. There has 
been much wrong at that hospital for many years but the NHS jackboot had
 ensured that everyone was firmly stamped upon and many matters which 
should have been made public remained concealed. The Cardiff and Vale 
University Health Board are the proud employers of the former sexual 
harasser of St George’s Hospital Medical School, Dr Richard Penketh (see
 post ‘The Battle Of The Cowshed’).</p>
<p>The second phase of the Children’s Hospital is actually being funded 
by the Welsh Gov’t and is costing many millions – the Noah’s Ark appeal 
is just funding a few extras, including of course a machine that goes 
ping.&nbsp; Nonetheless, even as Carwyn dispenses the dosh, he is still 
being drowned out by the sound of angry Top Doctors insisting that the 
citizens of Wales are dying because of Carwyn’s Cuts – the cuts that 
currently ensure that almost half of the Welsh Gov’ts budget is being 
spent on the NHS. If Carwyn doesn’t keep dishing out the dosh, there’ll 
be the folk involved with the Noah’s Ark appeal – who include Shirley 
Bassey and Charlotte Church as well as King Rat – to remind everyone 
that Carwyn is slaying the nation’s children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was in about 1987 that Fergus Lowe overthrew Dafydd’s influence in
 the School of Psychology at Bangor University. Under Fergus the School 
of Psychology rapidly expanded from – as one of the postgrads from that 
time observed – a derelict building on its last legs ear-marked for 
closure to virtually a university in its own right. My post ‘He’s Not 
The Messiah, He’s A Very Naughty Boy’ detailed some of the very 
unscrupulous methods which Fergus employed to build his empire, but if 
someone like Fergus found out that member of the Lords and Thatcher’s 
friend George Thomas was sexually abusing children – as well as 
Thatcher’s other friend and PPS/the Deputy Chairman of the Conservative 
Party Sir Peter Morrison – the potential for business to boom would be 
enormous. It also explains why although he was once to described to me 
as ‘the most hated man in Bangor’, no-one actually confronted Fergus 
about his enormous wrongdoing – of which there was plenty of evidence – 
and put him out of action.</p>
<p>In 1990 Michael Higham invited Thomas to attend a touring exhibition 
in Cardiff Masonic Hall, put on by the Association of Methodist 
Freemasons.</p>
<p>Between 1990-2004, Ian Lawrie Mackeson-Sandbach was Provincial Grand 
Master of North Wales. Another member of the Freemasons in north Wales 
is Hefin Davies, the former Chairman of the NW Wales NHS Trust. Whilst 
Hefin was Chairman, Hergest patients were abused and some of them died, 
yet even the most serious of complaints were not investigated. The Tory 
MP for Clwyd West, David Jones, is also a Freemason – David Jones is a 
solicitor who spent many years sitting in courts in north Wales watching
 the paedophiles’ friends fit people up but David said not a word (see 
post ‘The Right Honourable David Jones MP’). Ian’s daughter Antoinette 
Sandbach worked as a criminal barrister in London until she heard the 
call of the land a few years ago and returned to north Wales and took a 
‘low paid job’ on a ‘farm’. Antoinette didn’t stay living on the ‘farm’ 
that is the family’s estate that they inherited from their slave trader 
ancestors for very long – after a few weeks, she’d landed a job working 
for David Jones in his constituency office in Colwyn Bay! And before you
 could say ‘another paedophiles’ friend arrived to provide 
reinforcements now that there are demands for another inquiry’, 
Antoinette was on the candidates list for the Assembly and then was 
elected as an AM. Antoinette legged it for a safe Westminster seat at 
the first opportunity and now she’s backing old Theresa up in the 
Commons (see post ‘News Round Up, 19 January 2018’). Another Freemason 
in Colwyn Bay is former Denbigh nurse Nigel Mannering Berry, who managed
 the Gwynfa Unit, the adolescent mental health unit in Colwyn Bay where 
children were raped and violently assaulted (see post ‘Don’t Be Silly, 
He’s Nice’).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>George Thomas opposed the creation of the Welsh Office – it was set 
up after the 1964 General Election – because he feared that it would 
open the ‘floodgates of nationalism’. Ironically George Thomas soon 
became Minister of State and then Secretary of State in the Welsh 
Office. The first Secretary of State for Wales was Jim Griffiths and he 
was succeeded by Cledwyn Hughes. Cledwyn Hughes inherited the Welsh 
Language Bill from Griffiths – it was enacted in 1967 and allowed Welsh 
language evidence to be heard in courts and also allowed official 
documentation to be written in Welsh. It was actually Mandelson’s 
grandfather Herbert Morrison who in his capacity as Home Secretary 
introduced the Welsh Courts Act in 1942 – the 1967 Act extended the 
rights in the 1942 Act. Cledwyn Hughes was most enthusiastic in 
promoting the Welsh language but George Thomas had a very big problem 
with it and was contemptuous of the 1967 Act. One wonders how George 
Thomas felt when Lord Wyn Roberts twisted the arms of Thatcher and 
Willie Whitelaw into allowing the Welsh Language Act 1993 after Roberts 
was reminded by a few people that Thatcher et al were colluding with 
politicians who were sexually abusing children in care in Wales (see 
posts ‘The Cradle Of Filth’ and ‘A Bit More Paleontology’).</p>
<p>Whilst George Thomas was Minister of State at the Welsh Office, 
1966-68 and then Secretary of State for Wales, 1968-70, the Welsh Office
 concealed the abuses at the North Wales Hospital Denbigh and in the 
children’s homes in north Wales. Thomas also behaved in an utterly 
shabby way towards the mining communities of south Wales. When it was 
proposed to shut the mine at Glyncorrwg – the valley leading to Port 
Talbot – decisions over pit closures were being handled by the Dept of 
Fuel and Power, for which John Morris was Parliamentary Secretary. Under
 Parliamentary protocol Morris wasn’t allowed to decide the fate of a 
mine in his own constituency, so George Thomas, in his capacity as a 
Welsh Office Minister, made representation to Lord Robens the Chair of 
the NCB. Robens refused to give the pit a reprieve. Thomas described 
Robens as a ‘compassionate and kindly man’. Thomas showed the depths of 
his own kindness and compassion when, following the Aberfan tragedy, he 
ordered a huge proportion of the money that had been donated to the 
Aberfan Disaster Fund to be used to clean up the coal tips lest another 
few tons of waste fell on a few more buildings wiping everyone out, the 
NCB not being willing to stump up for this themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas made numerous influential friendships from his earliest years 
as an adult and used his connections for maximum effect. He was excused 
service in WWII and instead joined the special police in Tonypandy, 
serving as a sergeant. Thomas trained as a teacher at University 
College, Southampton and taught in London and south Wales.</p>
<p>Thomas was the Press and Parliamentary Secretary for the Cardiff 
Association of Teachers and was an activist in the NUT. In 1942 Thomas 
joined the NUT executive. He was a friend of Annie Thomas – later Annie 
Powell – a fellow teacher and NUT activist, who later became well known 
as a Communist Councillor and the Mayor of Rhondda, 1979-80.</p>
<p>It was Elizabeth Andrews, the women’s organiser for the Labour Party 
in Wales, who asked Thomas if she could put his name on the candidates 
list for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>Thomas was originally elected for Cardiff Central in 1945, but 
boundary changes resulted in the seat becoming Cardiff West in 1950. 
Thomas was in the House with Herbert Morrison, Mandelson’s grandfather, 
who was Leader of the Commons and Deputy PM 1945-51. Thomas fell out 
with Morrison in 1951 when Morrison was Deputy PM and overseeing the 
Festival of Britain, because Morrison planned to open Battersea Fun Fair
 on Sundays. After Thomas called Morrison a ‘little Londoner’ in a 
Commons speech, Morrison wrote to Thomas telling him that he’d never go 
to Cardiff to speak again.</p>
<p>Thomas was elected in the 1945 General Election in which Labour won a
 landslide victory which resulted in Clement Attlee becoming PM. However
 Labour’s election defeat in 1951 resulted in Labour – and George Thomas
 – being in opposition for 13 years. Throughout that time Thomas 
continued to build allies and friendships – even with people whose 
causes he chose not to actually support. In 1954 after the US detonated 
the H bomb at the Bikini Atoll, a ‘deeply shocked’ Thomas attended the 
meeting organised by the Labour MP Fenner Brockway, which was 
effectively the launch of CND. Thomas then attended the formal launch of
 CND at a rally&nbsp; in the Royal Albert Hall which was attended by the
 likes of Tony Benn and Tony Greenwood. Yet George Thomas decided not to
 actually join CND.</p>
<p>When Hugh Gaitskill died in 1963, Thomas backed Harold Wilson as 
leader of the Labour Party over his fellow Cardiff MP Jim Callaghan – 
who knew that Thomas was assaulting minors and who for years, including 
the years when he was PM, concealed the organised abuse of children in 
north Wales and elsewhere. Callaghan and Thomas hated each other. Wilson
 subsequently chose to launch the Labour Party’s 1964 election campaign 
in Cardiff.</p>
<p>After the 1964 General Election, Thomas was appointed as a junior 
Minister at the Home Office, responsible for immigration under Home 
Secretary Frank Soskice, a lawyer and the Labour MP for Newport. In his 
capacity as a Home Office Minister, in 1964 Thomas facilitated a meeting
 between Soskice and Peter Bessell – the man who always maintained that 
Thorpe was having gay relationships with minors including Norman Scott 
and who gave evidence at Thorpe’s 1979 trial that Thorpe had planned to 
have Norman killed – concerning Jeremy Thorpe. There are allegations 
that in 1960, under the Conservative Gov’t, political intervention 
stopped Thorpe being prosecuted for offences against a minor and that in
 1964 in the wake of further allegations, Thorpe was worried that the 
1960 case would become public. In 1976 journalists wanted to interview 
George Thomas about this and Leo Abse stated that Thomas was in a state 
of terror lest the journalist asked about his own sexuality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is evidence that with regard to corrupt business practices, 
George Thomas was compromised as long ago as April 1963. A letter was 
sent to Thomas at his home address from W.D. Blakeman and Co, detailing 
proposals for a big housing development that were to be put to Cardiff 
City Council and asking to meet a Labour MP to discuss the development 
and requesting members of the company to join the Labour Party. The 
development was in the hands of the City Housing Manager. Three months 
later, another Blakeman scheme concerning the building of homes in the 
Pentrebane and Trowbridge areas of Cardiff was approved.</p>
<p>George Thomas was a longstanding friend of Julian Hodge, whose 
business dealings were very questionable indeed. Hodge was basically a 
money lender – ‘Private Eye’ referred to him as ‘the usurer of the 
valleys’ – but he is quaintly described in his wiki entry as an 
‘entrepreneur and philanthropist’. Hodge acquired a personal fortune of 
over £60 million and was domiciled in Jersey. In 1970 he instituted the 
annual Jane Hodge lecture – in memory of his mother – and brought high 
profile speakers to Cardiff, including the Governor of the Bank of 
England, Prince Philip and Sheikh Yamani of Opec.</p>
<p>Hodge found himself at the centre of a particularly big row when it 
was revealed that his business the Hodge Group had lent money to 
immigrants in Birmingham and Lancashire at interest rates of up to 45%. 
In 1972 Julian Hodge established the Commercial Bank of Wales, later 
known as the Julian Hodge Bank. Hodge’s intention was for the Bank to 
deploy local depositors’ funds to finance industrial regeneration and 
turn Cardiff into a regional finance centre., although it didn’t quite 
work out that way. In 1981 the Bank of England refused to grant the 
Commercial Bank of Wales full banking status, although after Hodge had a
 hissy fit in 1982 Geoffrey Howe, then Chancellor, ensured that full 
banking status was conferred. George Thomas, Jim Callaghan and David 
Ormsby-Gore aka Lord Harlech – who died an untimely death, as have many 
members of his immediate family since he was killed (see post ’95 
Glorious Years ‘) – were founding Directors of the Commercial Bank of 
Wales.</p>
<p>Julian Hodge really liked bankrolling things and in 1969 he endowed a
 Chair of Business and Finance at UWIST, the institution which evolved 
into Cardiff University. Cardiff University’s website currently features
 the Julian Hodge Institute of Macroeconomics.</p>
<p>George Thomas spent years batting for a knighthood for Julian Hodge 
and persuaded Callaghan to assist with this. Callaghan wrote to Harold 
Wilson regarding the Investiture Honours, saying that he wanted to 
‘reinforce the pleas George Thomas has made’ for Hodge to be given a 
knighthood, although Hodge had to wait another year for his K – it was 
confirmed in June 1970.</p>
<p>Hodge was a Labour Party supporter and financially supported seven 
Labour MPs. However he really was not fussy with regard to whom he hung 
out with. He went drinking with Jeffrey Archer in the Carlton Club just 
before Archer was elected as a Tory MP and let Archer know that he’d 
given three million to charity.</p>
<p>Sir Archie Lush, the former political agent and friend of Nye Bevan, 
received a letter from Hodge concerning his support for charity – a copy
 of the letter was sent to George Thomas. Archie Lush was appointed 
Chair of the Welsh Hospital Board in 1964 and was responsible for 
allowing the horrors at the North Wales Hospital Denbigh to continue. 
Kenneth Rawnsley was Lush’s advisor. In 1969 as the victims of sex 
offenders were shocked, lobotomised, drugged and held in Dafydd’s 
dungeon, Archie was awarded a knighthood in the Investiture honours – 
for services to the social services in Wales.</p>
<p>How on earth has Dafydd managed to avoid ermine and membership of the Privy Council?</p>
<p>George Thomas was obviously thought to have a hotline to Julian Hodge
 with regard to tapping him for money for charity -the Rev Bob Mogan, 
the Baroness of Ely’s dad, wrote to Thomas asking for sponsorship for a 
concert in St David’s Hall in Cardiff connected with the Urdd. For the 
low down on the Rev Bob and the Baroness, see post ‘More Than Politics 
And Local Government’.</p>
<p>Hodge and George Thomas even managed to recommend an account at the 
Commercial Bank of Wales to Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil 
Minister, on an occasion when the Sheikh had sent his private jet over 
to Cardiff to pick up Thomas and Hodge and it needed refuelling. Hodge, 
his wife Moira and Thomas had made friends with the Sheikh during the 
summer of 1977 whilst on a ‘religious experience’ together.</p>
<p>Julian Hodge was instrumental in the foundation of the George Thomas 
Memorial Trust and after Thomas died Hodge wanted to turn his bungalow 
into a museum or shrine no less. Ted Heath of course left nearly all of 
his money to himself in his will with instructions that it should be 
used to turn his house into a museum which was laughable enough, but at 
least Arundells is big enough for tourists to wander around and look at.
 George Thomas lived in a bungalow in Cardiff – for many years he 
famously shared this bungalow with his mother – which I would have 
thought would have been a major constraint in transforming his home into
 a museum. However Thomas’s bungalow was at the Heath, very close to the
 University Hospital, so perhaps the entrance fee could have included a 
tour of the hospital to marvel at the Top Doctors who had concealed the 
fact that Thomas was a child molester, who had also managed to kill Lena
 Zavaroni after performing a lobotomy on her – there wasn’t an admission
 that they had given her a lobotomy, but look up the details, it was 
pretty much a lobotomy – and then provided the distressing conditions in
 which Ann Clwyd’s husband died.</p>
<p>I was recently told by a stranger that a great many people and 
grandiose institutions in Cardiff were so reluctant to fall out with 
George Thomas’s mate Mr Moneybags that anyone crossing the path of 
Dafydd the Facilitator in north Wales would find themselves under 
attack. Such as a Bangor graduate who took the piss out of Dafydd and 
the paedophiles.&nbsp; Ah well the whole lot of them are covered in crap
 now aren’t they.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For decades George Thomas was close to Gwynoro Jones, the Labour MP 
for Carmarthen, 1970-74. Thomas and Jones made the warm up speeches for 
Harold Wilson at Labour rallies in Wales. In 1969 at the best of 
Callaghan, Jones became the Research and PR Officer for the Labour Party
 in Wales which involved regular meetings with Thomas at Thomas’s house 
in Cardiff.</p>
<p>Gwynoro was Parliamentary Secretary to Roy Jenkins in 1974, when Roy 
Jenkins was Home Secretary and had busied himself concealing the 
paedophile gang at work in north Wales, as well as much other wrongdoing
 (see post ‘The Most Dangerous Man In The World – Part I’). In 1981 
Gwynoro joined Roy in founding the SDP and along with Tom Ellis, then 
the MP for Wrexham – who worked very hard at not noticing the paedophile
 gang operating on his doorstep (see post ‘The Celtic Iron Lady And Yet 
More History’) – formed ‘a strong Welsh voice’ in the UK SDP. Gwynoro 
was Chair of the SDP in Wales and Chaired the National Committee in 
Wales of the SDP-Liberal Alliance, 1983-89.</p>
<p>Gwynoro is still very active, he has a You Tube and a blog. The 
section on his blog detailing his political biography has a lovely 
collection of photos of Gwynoro with – variously – Stephen Kinnock, 
Vince Cable, Paddy Ashdown, Dafydd Wigley, Lord Elystan-Morgan and my 
old favourites Dr Death and Shirl.</p>
<p>Gwynoro Jones was an important ally of Thomas when Thomas was 
Secretary of State for Wales – whilst Thomas was Secretary of State, 
Elystan Morgan was a junior Minister in the Home Office, when the Home 
Office were directly responsible for the management of Bryn Estyn whilst
 the boys there were abused. Elystan Morgan was a friend of Gwynoro 
Jones and was a solicitor, barrister and circuit judge on the corrupt 
Chester and Wales Circuit. Lord Elystan-Morgan was President of 
Aberystwyth University, 1997-07, the home of many of the paedophiles’ 
friends (see post ‘A Bit More Paleontology’) – he was appointed 
President just as the Waterhouse Inquiry got off the ground.</p>
<p>Lord Barry Jones was described as being ‘very close indeed’ to George
 Thomas and Thomas’s ‘Parliamentary son’. Barry Jones was a teacher who 
trained at what later became Bangor University – he was President of 
Flint County NUT. Being President of the NUT in a county in which a 
paedophile gang was operating would have&nbsp; resulted in Lord Baz 
being party to much incriminating information. Lord Baz was MP for East 
Flintshire, 1970-83 – he succeeded Baroness Eirene White who mixed with 
many paedophiles’ friends herself (see post ‘A Bit More Paleontology’) –
 and then for Alyn and Deeside, 1983-87. Baz was a junior Minister in 
the Welsh Office, 1974-79. So he was in post when the Welsh Office were 
failing to inspect children’s homes in north Wales whilst the paedophile
 gang were busy inside them and were ignoring the serious criminality 
prevailing at the North Wales Hospital Denbigh. Lord Baz was appointed 
to the Intelligence and Security Committee by John Major in 1994, where 
he remained until 2001 – once the Waterhouse cover-up had been safely 
published. Whereupon Baz became a Lord. He had already been made a 
member of the Privy Council in 1999. In 2007 Lord Baz became President 
of NEWI (which became Glyndwr University) whilst the crazed Mike Scott 
was VC when it was a bizarre and troubled ship – in 2009 Lord Baz was 
appointed Chancellor. Glyndwr is a university with a very strong 
affinity indeed for paedophiles’ friends (see post ‘A Vampire At Glyndwr
 University!’). Baz is also President of the Deeside Business Forum – 
how is he so successful at persuading Gov’ts to invest there??</p>
<p>George Thomas’s other close friends included Greville Janner, Cyril 
Smith and Jeremy Thorpe. His pal Leo Abse has also been the subject of 
an investigation into historical child abuse. George Thomas was a friend
 of Enoch Powell as well – Powell too was the subject of a complaint of 
child abuse. When Enoch Powell was Health Minister in 1960 he visited 
the North Wales Hospital and was so shocked at what he saw that he told 
them that he would not allow them to do this to people and returned to 
London promising to shut the institution down. For some reason he 
dropped that plan very quickly and it was never mentioned again – 
neither are there any references to it in the archive of his papers. 
George Thomas was on good enough terms with Jonathan Aitken to dispense 
advice to him and act as a character witness when Aitken launched his 
libel action against the Guardian, which eventually led to Aitken’s 
imprisonment for perjury.</p>
<p>George Thomas became President of the NCH (National Children’s Home) 
in approx 1984 – he stood down at the end of 1994, by which time it was 
known as NCH/Action for Children. Many people associated with the NCH 
are now known to have concealed or colluded with child abuse (see post 
‘Always On The Side Of The Children’). Glanville Owen, the senior 
manager in Gwynedd Social Services with responsibility for children’s 
homes whilst the paedophile gang operated within them, had previously 
worked for the NCH (see post ‘I Know Nuzzing’).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shipton’s book about George Thomas tells us that some people, 
including former Tory MP Lord Patrick Cormack – a long time friend of 
Thomas and someone who has been in a position to know a great deal about
 the abuse of children and vulnerable people – simply do not believe the
 allegations that Thomas was a child abuser (see post ‘More Than 
Politics And Local Government’). I do not know what Lord Cormack’s 
position is now that South Wales Police have admitted that there were 
complaints about Thomas which were inexplicably not acted upon. Patrick 
Cormack was the person who facilitated George Thomas’s membership of the
 Athenaeum, a club popular with Top Doctors and lawyers, including many 
who have colluded with organised child abuse and criminal activity in 
psychiatry. Jimmy Savile was a member.</p>
<p>Shipton also quotes Dafydd Wigley, the MP for Caernarfon, 1974-01, 
and AM for the same constituency, 1999-03. Dafydd Wigley maintains that 
he really did not have any knowledge of Thomas’s offences. Indeed Wigley
 states that when he first went to Westminster he was ‘pretty naive’ and
 he thinks that many other MPs were as well. He told Shipton that not 
long after he became an MP, there were allegations that children were 
being abused in Ty’r Felin children’s home in Bangor, but because that 
home was actually in the constituency of Wyn Roberts ‘it was a matter 
for Wyn’. Dafydd remembers that ‘there were inquiries but I can’t 
remember the outcome of it…it was at that time that I first came across 
the word ‘paedophile’ and I didn’t know the meaning of the word…because 
it wasn’t on our radar then…’</p>
<p>There are a few points that need to be made in response to Dafydd 
Wigley’s claims of ‘I Know Nuzzing’. George Thomas’s activities were 
very widely known about in Westminster and in Wales, both north and 
south. People other than Dafydd Wigley have now admitted that it was 
common knowledge that Thomas was continually participating in casual 
sexual encounters and even as an old man had a taste for much younger 
men – including the younger men who were employed at Westminster who 
were sometimes bothered by him. Regarding Dafydd Wigley passing on the 
concerns to Wyn Roberts, the MP for Conwy – Ty’r Felin was in Roberts’s 
constituency, but Wyn Roberts and his boss Margaret Thatcher whom he who
 served slavishly did not have a very good track record when it came to 
defending the interests of children in care who were being abused and 
trafficked to London to be used for sex by members of the Tory Party, 
among others. Ty’r Felin was in Bangor which was in Roberts’s 
constituency – but the woman whom Waterhouse admitted ignored the 
paedophile ring who were abusing the children in care in north Wales and
 who was directly responsible for Ty’r Felin was not in Bangor. Lucille 
Hughes, the Director of Gwynedd Social Services, was sitting in an 
office in Caernarfon, just around the corner from Dafydd Wigley’s 
surgery and about three miles down the road from Dafydd Wigley’s house. 
As was Lucille’s boss, the Chief Exec of Gwynedd County Council, Ioan 
Bowen Rees. Ioan Bowen Rees was considered an expert in local government
 and two Plaid politicians consulted him for advice – one being a man 
called Dafydd Wigley and the other being Gwynfor Evans, who preceded 
Dafydd Wigley as President of Plaid. Lucille’s Deputy Director of Social
 Services directly responsible for Ty’r Felin – Glanville Owen – was 
also sitting in an office in Caernarfon. As was Ron Evans, the crooked 
lawyer employed by Gwynedd County Council who, in collusion with Lucille
 – Dr Dafydd Alun Jones’s mistress – and the staff of the Arfon 
Community Mental Health Team, were trying to fit me up for serious 
offences. Until about 1987, the Arfon Community Mental Health Team also 
had their offices in Caernarfon. Furthermore, Dafydd Wigley knew what 
that lot were doing to me – because I had written to him about it.</p>
<p>Of course Dafydd Wigley had probably had decades of opportunities to 
ask Dafydd Alun Jones why victims of the paedophile gang were finding 
themselves in the dungeon at Denbigh – because Dafydd Wigley and Dafydd 
Alun Jones were both standing as Plaid candidates before Plaid really 
took off as an electoral force. Dafydd Alun Jones stood as the Plaid 
candidate for Denbigh in 1959 and 1964. By the time that Dafydd Wigley 
was passing on matters to Wyn Roberts, he’d had quite a few decades to 
have a chat with Ioan Bowen Rees as well – Bowen Rees stood as the Plaid
 candidate for Conwy in 1955 and 1959 and for Methyr Tydfil in 1964. I 
am fairly sure that Dafydd Wigley and his wife used to live in south 
Wales before they moved up to Caernarfon – in a place called Methyr 
Tydfil I seem to remember…</p>
<p>Dafydd Wigley could have loaded up a few rucksacks with explosives, 
nipped out of his surgery and around the corner and blown the whole 
bloody lot of them sky high and resolved the problems at Ty’r Felin and 
in a great many other places for good. He did not do this. He replied to
 my first letter about the mental health services – he wrote a very nice
 reply telling me that if he could help at a Parliamentary level he 
would. I was delighted and my friends were really impressed. The mental 
health services then came after me again repeatedly and I went through a
 period of being too ill and too busy trying to keep myself alive and 
out of prison to write to anyone. When I recovered sufficiently I wrote 
to Dafydd Wigley again. I did not receive a response.</p>
<p>Dafydd Wigley didn’t always pass matters on to Wyn if they concerned 
people in Wyn’s constituency. During one General Election campaign, 
someone canvassing for Wyn Roberts was rash enough to ring my 
house&nbsp; -which was located in Roberts’s constituency – and ask if 
people in the house were going to vote Tory. I didn’t answer the phone, 
the person whom&nbsp; I lived with did. He was so outraged at a 
supporter of the Conservative Party cold calling that he immediately 
rang the house of another local MP who was not a Tory – Dafydd Wigley. 
Dafydd Wigley’s wife answered, she was ever so nice and explained that 
Dafydd was on his way back from London and that she would let him know 
that there’d been a phone call for him as soon as he got in. I was well 
impressed when later on that evening Dafydd Wigley rang. I have no idea 
at all whether he knew whose house he had rung, but the person with whom
 I lived had a long chat with Dafydd Wigley, who agreed that the Tories 
ringing up unsuspecting non-Tory households was completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Lord Wigley – the person to whom you spoke that night had, years 
before, been beaten up by the North Wales Police, fitted up for serious 
offences, imprisoned and then packed off to Denbigh, unlawfully. Where –
 after being left to rot for a very, very long time – Dr Dafydd Alun 
Jones tried to coerce him into going to live at Holyrood House in 
Llandudno, the ‘nursing home’ exposed by Esther on That’s Life in about 
1987, in which Dafydd’s patients were being beaten up and abused by a 
bunch of hired thugs from Liverpool. Dafydd was so keen that this man 
should join those who were having the living daylights kicked out of 
them in Llandudno that he refused to let this man out of Denbigh – on 
the grounds that he had nowhere to live. So without telling the Angels, 
this interned prisoner rang up a mate in Bethesda and that mate wrote to
 Denbigh – I think that he might have signed himself ‘Dr’ what with him 
having a PhD just to shut Dafydd up – explaining to Dafydd that this man
 had accommodation arranged in Bethesda. That was the only reason why 
that man ever got out of Denbigh – although he was held there completely
 illegally. This man was one of many who had worked at the children’s 
homes in north Wales and had witnessed for himself the abuse of the kids
 – which might well have been why just months later, after having told 
people what was going on, he received a visit from the North Wales 
Police.</p>
<p>‘We didn’t know.’</p>
<p>Those kids were screaming for help before they were found dead. They could not have screamed louder if they had tried.</p>
<p>Regarding Dafydd Wigley not remembering the outcome of the inquiry 
into Ty’r Felin children’s home – Ty’r Felin was discussed in the 
Waterhouse Report in considerable detail. Even Sir Ronald Waterhouse 
admitted that children from Ty’r Felin were mercilessly abused, both 
physically and sexually by Nefyn and June Dodd who ran the place and 
were forced to work for no pay in local businesses. Ronald Waterhouse 
also noted that a letter had been sent from Risley Remand Centre to 
Lucille Hughes in support of Nefyn and June Dodd, purporting to be from a
 former resident of Ty’r Felin, who was giving evidence at the Inquiry. 
Waterhouse accepted that the letter was a forgery and declared that he 
would therefore ignore it and say no more about it. The only surprise is
 that he didn’t pass it onto Wyn Roberts to deal with.</p>
<p>How Dafydd Wigley forgot about the shitstorm that was the Waterhouse 
Report I do not know. Particularly as Lucille Hughes resigned hours 
after it was published and appeared on Welsh news snapping at the 
reporter ‘I am not resigning, I am retiring’.</p>
<p>As for not knowing the word ‘paedophile’ – there is an outside chance
 that Lord Wigley might not have. But he would have known what the 
phrases ‘interfering with children’ or ‘child molesting’ meant – which 
were the phrases usually used pre-1990 to describe what George Thomas 
was doing.</p>
<p>For the benefit of Lord Wigley, the Welsh word for paedophile is 
‘paedoffilydd’ – the plural is ‘paedoffilyddion’. So now you never need 
to plead ignorance again Lord W!</p>
<p>Dafydd Wigley has had a long and close association with Bangor 
University and in 2003 was appointed Pro-Chancellor of the University of
 Wales, of which Bangor was a then a constituent college and had been 
for decades. Bangor University’s Depts of Social Work and Psychology 
employed people who were colleagues of the paedophile gang and some of 
the graduates of those depts worked with the paedophile gang. Dafydd 
Alun Jones wielded so much influence in the Psychology Dept that his 
daughter Dwynwen was given a place to do a PhD although her degree 
wasn’t good enough to have been awarded that place. Dafydd then tried to
 steal a load of money from the Psychology Dept, but Fergus Lowe put a 
stop to it, overthrew him and spent the rest of his days blackmailing 
drug companies with Top Doctors on their Boards, research funding 
bodies, other universities and hospitals as well as politicians who knew
 about Dafydd and co but had colluded with him or remained silent.</p>
<p>Dafydd Wigley grew up in north Wales and went to Caernarfon Grammar 
School – he probably knew the grandfathers of the current crop of 
paedophiles’ friends…</p>
<p>I still cannot understand how so many people could have been so stupid, so weak and so unscrupulous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>George Thomas died in September 1997. During his final illness he had
 been treated by Dr Adrian Timothy at Tommy’s. There was a memorial 
service held at Westminster Abbey for Thomas. Among those present were 
Jim Callaghan, Tony Blair, William Hague and Prince Charles.</p>
<p>The bodies in the grounds of the North Wales Hospital are unmarked.</p>

		<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; text-align: left;">Thanks to my 
correspondent Lydia for bringing my attention to yet another leading 
light in psychiatry in Wales – Kenneth Rawnsley, who was Professor of 
Psychological Medicine at Cardiff, 1964-85. Not only did Prof Ken know 
all about Dr Dafydd Alun Jones and the paedophiles, but he was the man 
who gave Dafydd’s therapeutic community in the cellar of the North Wales
 Hospital Denbigh the official stamp of approval and who reassured 
everyone that standards at Denbigh were fine. Ken did this whilst all 
those folk who had dared challenge the paedophiles and their friends 
were illegally imprisoned in Denbigh and whilst the elderly lady Mary 
was still locked inside that place for no other reason than 60 years 
previously she had given birth without being married (see post ‘A Galaxy
 Of Talent’). Ken also taught Tony Francis (Dr X) and was the ultimate 
boss of the team that Francis worked in when Francis worked in Cardiff. 
Ken was President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1981-84.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rawnsley was born in Halifax, went to Burnley Grammar School and then
 Manchester University where he qualified in 1948. He worked as a house 
physician to Robert – later Lord – Platt (see post ‘The Creme de la 
Creme’) in 1949 at Manchester Royal Infirmary. The Royal College of 
Physicians website’s section on ‘Lives of the Fellows’ tells us that 
there was a ‘galaxy of gifted young men’ –&nbsp; yet another galaxy of 
Top Doctors – working under Platt at the time, one of whom was Douglas 
Black. Black&nbsp; later became President of the Royal College of 
Physicians, 1977-83 and authored the Black Report on inequalities which 
pissed Thatcher off so much. Although Platt’s first wife Muriel had been
 a psychiatrist, Platt tried to persuade Rawnsley not to go into 
psychiatry because it simply wasn’t considered an option for capable 
people.</p>
<p>Rawnsley nonetheless pursued psychiatric training at Manchester’s 
Academic Dept of Psychiatry under Professor Edward Anderson. Anderson 
had spent the early part of his career in Germany and was influenced by 
Kurt Schneider and Karl Jaspers. Anderson been taught in the tradition 
of European psychological phenomenology and as well as in the psychology
 of Adolf Meyer. He had also worked as a consultant at the Maudsley.</p>
<p>Others who worked in Anderson’s team whom Rawnsley knew included: 
William Trethowan who was at that time a lecturer; Jack Kenna, a 
lecturer in clinical psychology; May Irvine, a lecturer in psychiatric 
social work; Lawton Tonge, a registrar.</p>
<p>William Trethowan became a very senior figure in psychiatry. His 
father had been an orthopaedic surgeon at Guys and died when Trethowan 
was 16. After his father’s death, Trethowan’s mother enrolled as&nbsp; 
medical student – Trethowan and his mother graduated on the same day.</p>
<p>Trethowan went to Oundle School and then Clare College, Cambridge. At
 Cambridge he was musical director of Footlights. Trethowan graduated 
from Guys in 1943 and married the actress Pam Waters. After service in 
the RAMC, he worked as&nbsp; psychiatric registrar at the Maudsley, 
1948-50. Trethowan then spent a year as a psychiatric resident in 
Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard and spent the years 1951-56 as a
 lecturer and then senior lecturer at Manchester University, where 
Rawnsley got to know him. Trethowan was appointed Professor of 
Psychiatry at the University of Sydney in 1956. In 1962 he returned to 
the UK as Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Birmingham after 
being head hunted, where he remained until he retired in 1982. Trethowan
 spent 8 years as the Dean of Medicine at Birmingham. Whilst at 
Birmingham Trethowan was a colleague of Robert Bluglass who concealed 
the criminality of the north Wales mental health services in 1988, more 
of which later on in this post.</p>
<p>Trethowan was an advisor in psychiatry to the DHSS, 1964-78 and 
Chaired the Standing Mental Health Advisory Committee, 1968-74. He 
Chaired the Advisory Committee which was set up to establish the Chinese
 University of Hong Kong, 1976-86.</p>
<p>Trethowan’s&nbsp; obituary stated that he did much to improve 
standards in psychiatry and ‘worked both in committee and behind the 
scenes to ensure that the new college [Royal College of Psychiatrists] 
would reach the highest standards of professional excellence’. Just how 
successful Trethowan was in this we shall soon see. Trethowan was the 
first Chief Examiner of the Royal College and ‘almost single-handedly’ 
set up the exam for membership.</p>
<p>Trethowan was a member of the GMC and for a while its Treasurer. 
Trethowan was a member of the GMC panel who in 1970 allowed the 
paedophile child psychiatrist Dr Morris Fraser to continue to practice. 
Fraser was later convicted of child sexual abuse. The GMC legal officer 
for the case was Sir Patrick Mayhew, who years later in his capacity as 
Attorney General authorised two prosecutions against me for contempt of 
court on the basis of the perjury of members of staff employed by the 
north Wales mental health services.</p>
<p>Mayhew was Secretary of State for N Ireland, 1992-97. He was 
appointed days before that petrol bomb killed five witnesses to the 
North Wales Child Abuse Scandal (see post ‘The Silence of the Welsh 
Lambs’). Whilst in post, Mayhew was one of many who concealed the abuse 
scandal at the Kincora Boys Home in Belfast, which was said to involve 
members of the British Army as well as Whitehall figures. Morris Fraser 
was involved with Kincora.</p>
<p>In the 1970s Jack Kenna who was then based at Gaskell House at 
Manchester Royal Infirmary worked with psychiatrist Professor David 
Goldberg at Withington Hospital on gender reassignment. They only 
treated a very small number of people and were consistent with most of 
their peers in viewing gender reassignment cases as rare interesting 
specimens.</p>
<p>William Lawton Tonge was a psychiatrist who graduated from Manchester
 University in 1948. He worked at Manchester Royal Infirmary and 
Holloway Sanatorium and then was appointed registrar to the dept of 
psychiatry at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1951. Tonge worked at the 
MRC Unit for Research into Social Psychiatry and was then appointed 
consultant psychiatrist at Sheffield Royal Infirmary.</p>
<p>Tonge was Deputy Medical Superintendent of the private Cheadle Royal 
Hospital near Manchester and a member of the Society for the Study of 
Addiction.</p>
<p>Tonge carried out a lot of work on ‘problem families’ in which he 
sought to identify a common psychological maladjustment in such families
 whose principal problem was poverty.</p>
<p>There is a Lawton Tonge House in Sheffield which houses Sheffield 
MIND – but then MIND named one of their buildings William Bingley House.</p>
<p>Rawnsley remembered Anderson’s ‘deep rooted humanity and compassion’.
 Yet in an interview with Brian Barraclough published in the Psychiatric
 Bulletin in 1988, Rawnsley clearly stated that although Anderson was 
interested in phenomenological formulation and diagnosis, ‘treatment was
 not high on the agenda’ – indeed that Anderson was&nbsp; a ‘therapeutic
 nihilist’. Anderson had been appointed as the first Professor of 
Psychiatry at Manchester in 1949, when Manchester was a ‘psychiatric 
wilderness’. By 1951 Anderson was using ECT, leucotomy, insulin coma and
 modified insulin therapy, but he had no ‘modern psychotropic drugs’. 
Rawnsley stated that in Anderson’s dept the only ‘psychotherapy in vogue
 was supportive therapy…valuable in the management of chronic 
personality problems’.</p>
<p>The notion of ‘chronic personality problems’ is a favourite one of 
particularly abusive Top Doctors. Dafydd, Tony Francis, Neil Davies and 
Tony Roberts found their clinics heaving with patients with chronic 
personality problems, as I’m sure did those concealing their wrongdoing 
at St George’s Hospital Medical School and Springfield Hospital. These 
were the patients who had dared question them or even complain who then 
found themselves threatened, abused and finally refused treatment. Some 
of these patients had no problems in their relationships with the rest 
of the world and some managed to have successful careers and families. 
The only people with whom they had problems were the Top Doctors and 
they were therefore deemed to have chronic personality problems.</p>
<p>It is clear from Rawnsley’s interview with Barraclough that Anderson 
and indeed Rawnsley himself did not view patients as people to be 
helped. They were there to be experimented upon by these men of science –
 who were not actually accepted as being men of science in any way by 
other men of science like Robert Platt. Rawnsley mentions that there was
 no hospital attached to the Academic Unit at Manchester, just a small 
number of beds – where the patients were shocked and lobotomised and put
 into comas. Anderson et al had some beds at the private Cheadle Royal 
Hospital and I suspect that was where the psychotherapy for those with 
chronic personality problems took place. God help you if you were one of
 the NHS patients, it was medical experiments and psychosurgery for you.</p>
<p>Anderson and Rawnsley gave some patients LSD ‘not because we thought 
it would do them any good but we wanted to see whether a schizophrenic 
patient could distinguish between the disturbances produced by LSD and 
the endogenous disturbance’.&nbsp; Anderson and Rawnsley published the 
results, although Rawnsley admitted to Barraclough that giving patients 
LSD was&nbsp; &nbsp;‘on reflection’ ‘not a good thing to do’. I very 
much doubt that he ever fessed that up to the patients whom he’d dosed.</p>
<p>Rawnsley and Anderson took LSD themselves – it was very new, having 
only been synthesized by Hofman in 1943 – because ‘it sounded 
interesting’. Others in their dept took it as well, including Bob 
Mowbray a clinical psychologist, Dr Paul Scott and the departmental 
secretary Doris Bee. Not that this was a problem – there was huge 
interest in LSD at the time, no-one had ever come across anything like 
it and of course curious people would have given it a go, I certainly 
would have. What interests me is that Rawnsley and co all described 
stereotypical acid trips which then ended very badly and decided ‘never 
again’ – Brian Barraclough also admitted to trying LSD but concluding 
that it was dangerous – but Rawnsley and Anderson then gave it to 
patients regardless to see what would happen. Rawnsley was not a man 
bothered by self doubt – if he had decided ‘on reflection’ that giving 
patients LSD had not been a good idea, it was probably because he’d done
 them great damage.</p>
<p>Rawnsley also took mescaline and was in contact with Dr Joel Elkes. 
Joel Elkes ran a unit Birmingham University in which he experimented 
extensively with LSD. The treatment unit was established in 1958 at 
Potwick Hospital in Worcestershire. Over the next 10 years more than 
15,000 doses of LSD were given to some 900 patients. Joel Elkes was 
involved in the CIA ‘mind control’ experiments with US doctors such as 
Lauretta Bender. Bender was responsible for some serious atrocities such
 as subjecting children as young as five and six to LSD experiments and 
ECT without anaesthetic or muscle relaxants which resulted in fractured 
vertebrae. One child who was the subject of the CIA experiments lived to
 tale the tale and qualified as an attorney when she was an adult. She 
tried to publish an account of what had been done to her and was told by
 the CIA that her career would be ended if she did. She later published 
under a pseudonym. Elkes also had links to the Pentagon as well as to 
MI6. It has been alleged that Potwick was partly funded by the CIA, MI6 
and the Macy Foundation – somehow Elkes raised $75,000 over ten years to
 help run it. Elke’s Birmingham University unit was founded with a 
$84,000 Rockefeller grant and the local Health Authority paid for its 
upkeep and running costs. Years later there were a number of successful 
court cases against Potwick Hospital brought by patients who had been 
the subjects of experimentation. In 1968 Potwick Hospital was the star 
of a World In Action investigative documentary revealing appalling abuse
 and neglect of elderly patients. The scandal led to Potwick being the 
first institution to be selected for closure under the community care 
programme – the last patients were discharged from Potwick in 1989.</p>
<p>Kenneth Rawnsley left the Manchester University dept in 1953 and 
Anderson left in 1965. Anderson moved to Sussex and became a Lord 
Chancellor’s visitor.</p>
<p>In 1954 Rawnsley went to work at the Maudsley, where he joined Dr 
Denis Leigh in the Psychotherapy Unit. It might have been a 
psychotherapy unit but on his first day Rawnsley was sent by Leigh to a 
mortuary in the East End of London to collect the brain of one of 
Leigh’s patients whom Leigh had heard had died. Rawnsley was dispatched 
with a biscuit tin in which to transport the brain and ended up having a
 ‘tussle with the pathologist’ who did not want to hand it over. 
Rawnsley won the fight over the brain and it was taken to the Maudsley 
by Rawnsley via a tram journey, obviously without the knowledge of the 
relatives of the person whose brain it was.</p>
<p>Denis Leigh went to Hulme Grammar School and qualified at Manchester 
University in 1939. He then worked as&nbsp; a house surgeon to Geoffrey 
Jefferson, a leading neurosurgeon. During World War II Leigh was a 
regimental medical officer after which he specialised in neurology. 
Leigh worked at the Oxford Head Injury Centre and also worked as an 
advisor in neurology in the Eastern Army in India. Leigh retained his 
links to the British Army and was an honorary consultant to the Army 
until 1980.</p>
<p>After demobilisation Leigh worked in the neurology dept of the London Hospital with Lord Brain and George Redditch.</p>
<p>Leigh then spent 18 months as a registrar at the Maudsley where he 
trained with Eric Huffman and C. P. Blacker. Carl Blacker was involved 
in a bizarre plan to inseminate a patient with the sperm of King George 
VI – see post ‘The King’s Sperm’. Leigh followed that up with one year 
at Harvard as a Clinical Fellow.</p>
<p>Leigh did not have a qualification in psychiatry, he called himself a consultant physician and always wore a white coat at work.</p>
<p>In 1948 Leigh became a consultant at the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley 
Hospitals. He was a Governor of the Maudsley and Chair of the Medical 
Committee there.</p>
<p>Denis Leigh was yet another person with an interest in psychosomatic 
medicine and he published with Ted Marley on psychosomatic aspects of 
bronchial asthma. Leigh also translated a volume concerning 
psychosomatic methods in painless childbirth. If one has the sort of 
asthma or birth that can be managed by psychological efforts this sort 
of work is very helpful but I suspect that if one didn’t Dr Leigh would 
resort to shouting accusations about malingering.</p>
<p>Leigh was also constructed as a forensic and medico-legal expert. He 
ran a big Harley Street pratice and worked as an expert witness in 
personal injury claims before the civil courts until just before he died
 in 1988.</p>
<p>Denis Leigh was someone who as an ‘independent psychiatrist’ assessed
 accused prisoners in the late 1950s/early 1960s and one of those 
assessed by Leigh was Guentha Podola in 1959. Podola was accused of 
murdering a policeman. Not only did Podola maintain that&nbsp; he 
suffered from amnesia and had no memory of the alleged murder, but there
 were allegations that the policeman had assaulted Podola. Leigh gave 
evidence that Podola was feigning amnesia and Podola was hung.</p>
<p>Denis Leigh also gave evidence for the prosecution in the Lady 
Chatterley’s Lover trial, but the failure of that prosecution was blamed
 on the mad old barrister Mervyn Griffiths-Jones rather than the mad old
 expert witness.</p>
<p>Leigh gave evidence in support of the civil case brought by IRA 
suspect Sean McKenna. In 1971 McKenna was one of the ‘hooded men’ who 
was interned and tortured by the RUC Special Branch under the 
instructions of the British Army as part&nbsp; of Operation Demetrius. 
Lord Carrington, the Secretary of State for Defence in Heath’s Gov’t, 
knew about the torture of IRA suspects and supported it, just as he and 
others knew about the abuse of children in the Kincora Boys Home in 
Belfast by Whitehall figures and members of the British Army and 
concealed it.</p>
<p>Sean McKenna brought a civil claim and in 1975 at he request of the 
Crown Solicitors Leigh examined McKenna. Leigh agreed that at the time 
of his torture McKenna had a pre-existing heart condition which was 
known about and that McKenna’s torture at the hands of the RUC had 
caused him serious damage. McKenna died days after being examined by 
Leigh. The Pat Finucane Centre holds documents relating to this case and
 there is the letter that Leigh wrote to an S. Noel Rea Esq at the Chief
 Counsel’s Office at the Royal Courts of Justice (Ulster). Leigh 
mentions that McKenna died days after he examined him and that how 
fortunate it was for Leigh that McKenna hadn’t died just a couple of 
days previously within hours of Leigh having seen him.</p>
<p>In 2015 The Irish Times carried a news article stating that the human
 rights lawyer Amal Clooney was part of a team led by Ben Emerson QC who
 were hoping to re-open the case of McKenna and the other hooded men. 
Amal Clooney works at Doughty Street Chambers, as does Helena Kennedy.</p>
<p>Kennedy has used the services of Professor Nigel Eastman at St 
George’s Hospital Medical School for many of her cases and she 
acknowledges him in one of her books (see post ‘Eve Was Framed – As Were
 A Lot Of Other People’). Eastman was one of those who was faced with 
evidence of Dafydd’s criminality in 1991 but who remained silent. 
Kennedy was involved with the charity WISH (Women In Special Hospitals) 
and undoubtedly knew that some of the women in those places had been 
abused as children in care and whilst in the mental health system but 
did not say a word, even when Jimmy Savile was put in charge of 
Broadmoor. Kennedy was also involved with the case of Emma Humphreys who
 died shortly after being released from prison on appeal when 
represented by Kennedy. Emma died in inexplicable circumstances about 
which Kennedy has also remained quiet.</p>
<p>Theodore Huckle also works at Doughty Street. Whilst Theo was Counsel
 General for Wales he was given access to all the documents now in my 
posession which contain written evidence of serious criminal activities 
on the part of Top Doctors, Angels, NHS managers, the social services, 
probation officers, police officers, lawyers, judges, the Mental Health 
Act Commission and others. Theo made no comment about any of it and 
stated that there was no evidence that I had ever been treated 
negligently (see post ‘Theo Huckle QC’).</p>
<p>Ben Emerson QC is one of the barristers who resigned from IICSA (the 
Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse) after allegations of 
unacceptable conduct were made against him.</p>
<p>The National Archives also holds a report compiled by Denis Leigh 
which is embargoed for decades to come – there is no indication as to 
what this report is about.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that as well as knowing Dafydd from the Maudsley 
that Denis Leigh knew the neurosurgeon Sir Charles Evans, who later 
became Principal of UCNW (Bangor University). Evans trained in 
neurosurgery at Oxford and neurosurgery is a small and exclusive 
business. Evans was just three years younger than Leigh. When Evans ran 
UCNW he employed the paedophiles’ friends as social work and clinical 
psychology tutors, used the services of Gwynne the lobotomist and the 
corrupt GP David Wood in the Student Health Centre and allowed Dafydd to
 dictate what went on in the psychology dept (see ‘A Bit More 
Paleontology’).</p>
<p>Sir Charles Evans was a member of the team which conquered Everest in
 1953 – the leader of the team was John Hunt. John Hunt spent his career
 in Military Intelligence and wrote the Hunt Report as&nbsp; result of 
his advisory work on policing in N Ireland. The Hunt Report recommended 
the creation of a military reserve – the result was the UDR which was 
infiltrated by paramilitaries who accessed weapons to murder Catholics.</p>
<p>Volunteers for the UDR were vetted by British Army Intelligence and 
the RUC Special Branch. The security services will have known which UDR 
volunteers were murderers, in exactly the same way that they knew that 
Jimmy Savile was a paedophile, as was Sir Peter Morrison and that Dafydd
 and co were running a paedophile gang. It has been acknowledged that 
there was a policy to kill members of the IRA anyway and no doubt Dafydd
 and his atrocities were concealed on the basis of a Lord Denning 
argument – that this is so bad we must not admit that it’s going on. 
Which is not a sensible approach to take towards someone like Dafydd, it
 wasn’t as if he was going to stop running a crime empire or go away.</p>
<p>That will be how Dafydd was propped up by the Army and the security services.</p>
<p>Leigh was Secretary General of the World Psychiatric Association, 
1966-78 and opposed many of his colleagues in arguing against the 
expulsion of the Soviet Union from the WPA on the grounds of political 
dissidents in the USSR being held in mental hospitals.</p>
<p>One of Leigh’s colleagues remembered that Leigh’ s guiding principal 
was that ‘ethics must guide all we do in psychiatry’. Denis’s Royal 
College of Psychiatrists obituary – written by a Peter Noble – stated 
that it would be for ‘his warmth and kindness as a doctor and teacher 
that he will be most fondly remembered’.</p>
<p>Denis had a son, Nigel, who inherited Denis’s propensity to be&nbsp; a
 Top Doctor. Professor Nigel Leigh is the Professor of Neurology at 
Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Nigel studied medicine at the London
 Hospital and subsequently worked at the institutions who for years did a
 fine job of concealing the wrongdoing of Dafydd and the paedophiles’ 
friends – Southampton University Medical School, St George’s and the 
Atkinson Morley. In 1989 Nigel Leigh bagged the Chair in Clinical 
Neurology at the Institute of Psychiatry. He was also honorary 
consultant at King’ s College Hospitals NHS Trust and the South London 
and Maudsley NHS Trust. In 1990 Nigel Leigh set up one of the first 
multi-professional clinics within the NHS for MND (motor neurone 
disease) offering both medical treatment and therapies on an outpatients
 basis.</p>
<p>In 2008 BBC News reported that Nigel Leigh’s team were researching 
the use of lithium for the treatment of MND. Nigel Leigh and Professor 
Steve Field the then President of the Royal College of General 
Practitioners stressed that lithium was very toxic, had serious side 
effects such as kidney damage and that patients mustn’t just try it out 
for themselves outside of the clinical trial.</p>
<p>At the Hergest Unit patients with a variety of diagnoses were 
liberally prescribed lithium. Yes, it was explained that lithium was 
toxic and therefore patients would need regular blood tests to ensure 
the level of lithium in their blood wasn’t reaching a dangerous level. 
However, the results often weren’t returned from the labs but the 
prescribing simply continued regardless. Furthermore the labs at Ysbyty 
Gwynedd were in chaos anyway, so no-one could ever have been certain 
what anybody’s lithium levels were. The patients were all at risk and 
the Top Doctors knew it.</p>
<p>Ted Marley was also a member of Denis Leigh’s team whilst Rawnsley 
worked there. I have found one reference to Ted Marley being involved 
with sex therapy but apart from that he left no trace behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Among all the grandiose pompousing, 
Rawnsley observed that at the Maudsley there was a ‘feeling of 
uneasiness and uncertainty among many of the trainees…level of 
information coming out of the ‘oracles’ was not terribly high. People 
didn’t know what their future was going to be. And they worried about 
it’.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have heard this again and again from people in medicine. Students 
in the early years of medical school imagine that the day that they 
qualify will mean the end of the crap, but as a friend of mine from 
school told me when she was in her first year as a house officer, it is 
just the beginning. That friend studied medicine at Cardiff. She told me
 that none of the students wanted to go into psychiatry after having 
completed their psych block and that none of them wanted placements in 
north Wales for anything because the stories about medical practice in 
north Wales – particularly Bangor- from returning students were just so 
grim. Junior doctors are retained on short term contracts and are 
entirely dependent upon the reference from their last boss for their 
next job. One step out of line and they are finished – they all know it.
 If you are a student or junior doctor and you find out that someone is 
shagging and killing their patients or running a paedophile ring, you 
just stay well away. When I worked at St George’s I noticed that the 
other doctors and medical students had a very low opinion of the 
psychiatrists at Springfield&nbsp; – they were deemed to be mad and 
incompetent…</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rawnsley spent six months bonding with 
Denis Leigh and very probably Dafydd himself because Dafydd did a stint 
training as a ‘psychotherapist’ at the Maudsley at the knee of Dr Bob 
Hobson and it will have been in the late 50s or early 60s. Bob Hobson’s 
right hand man at the Maudsley Russell Meares has written much about 
borderline personality disorder and is now a leading light at the 
University of Sydney in Australia. What Bob Hobson and Russell Meares 
turned a blind eye to with regard to their two ‘trainees’ Dafydd and 
Tony Francis was so bad that there will be a blog post special on Hobson
 and Meares coming soon. You should have raised the alarm Meares and you
 know it. After Rawnsley spent a short time working with the silly 
fuckers who unleashed two quite deranged criminals onto north Wales, he 
moved to the Professorial Unit at the Maudsley to work with David 
Davies.</p>
<p>David Davies was the Dean of the Institute of Psychiatry/Maudsley, 
1950-66. Davies went to St John’s College Oxford and then did his 
clinical training at Manchester, qualifying in 1936. He spent some time 
in the RAMC, arrived at the Maudsley in 1946 and remained there until 
his retirement in 1976. Davies’s obituaries described him as having been
 crucially involved with the fortunes of the Bethlem Royal and the 
Maudsley Hospitals and with the post-war development of the Institute of
 Psychiatry. He was a consultant at the joint hospitals from 1946. We 
are told that Davies turned Aubrey Lewis’s ‘vision of a centre of 
excellence into a reality’ and that Lewis had ‘an ideal of eclectic 
scholarship and insistence on high standards of patient care’.</p>
<p>Davies carried out work on alcoholism and in 1962 his ‘international 
reputation in this field was borne overnight’ when Davies published a 
short paper on seven alcohol addicts who all allegedly returned to 
normal drinking. This was a ‘revolutionary claim’ because until then it 
had been believed that ‘once an alcoholic always an alcoholic’. There 
was a snag though. Not only did subsequent research suggest that some of
 Davies’ s findings ‘were faulty’ but not all of his sample were alcohol
 dependent.</p>
<p>So Davies drew erroneous conclusions from a sample of seven some of 
whom didn’t fit the sampling criteria – thus was his international 
reputation established overnight. That sounds to me sufficient grounds 
to fail a Bachelor’s degree, rather than to establish an international 
reputation.</p>
<p>On the basis of his international reputation, Davies then set up the 
Alcohol Education Centre – that was for reasons unexplained ‘short 
lived’ – and became the President of the Society for the Study of 
Addiction as well as a member of the editorial board of the Journal of 
Addiction.</p>
<p>When Dafydd set up CAIS in 1977 he stated that CAIS wasn’t about 
promoting abstinence, it was about normal drinking. I just presumed that
 was Dafydd’s excuse to carry on boozing – he was widely reputed to be 
an alcoholic – but obviously Dafydd was taking his cue from the centre 
of excellence and those with international reputations.</p>
<p>Don’t AA still say ‘once an alcoholic always an alcoholic’?</p>
<p>There is a telling anecdote related by Professor Norman Kreitman in 
his interview with David Tait published in the Psychiatric Bulletin in 
1995. When Kreitman was a young man considering a career in psychiatry 
he wrote to Davies when Davies was the Dean at the Maudsley. Davies 
invited him to drop in and visit so Kreitman did. After a brief 
discussion Davies asked Kreitman if he’d like to meet one of the 
consultants. Kreitman said yes and spent an hour discussing the state of
 West End Theatre with him and then left. Days later Kreitman was 
surprised to receive a letter telling him that he’d been accepted and 
would be starting in two weeks.</p>
<p>Dafydd ‘trained’ at the Maudsley whilst Davies was Dean so presumably was subjected to a similarly gruelling selection process.</p>
<p>Kreitman mentioned that the Alcohol and Research Council was set up 
in 1982 and that the group awarding the research grants weren’t research
 experts. I expect that Dafydd got a grant out of them.</p>
<p>One of the people who Norman Kreitman worked with was Peter 
Sainsbury. Sainsbury’s research interest was suicide. Sainsbury worked 
as a registrar at the Maudsley and then worked at the Institute for 
Psychiatry, 1949-54. Sainsbury completed his MD in 1955 on suicide in 
London and in 1957 became the Director of the MRC Clinical Psychiatry 
Research Unit at Graylingwell Hospital, Chichester. Sainsbury noticed 
the high suicide rate among psychiatric patients. He became an advisor 
to WHO and served on MRC committees, including one on the epidemiology 
of drug dependency, 1967-69 and on a working party on parasuicide, 
1980-82.</p>
<p>Sainsbury was visiting Chair at the University of Queensland in 1972.
 He was Chair of the Royal College’s Committee on the Political Abuse of
 Psychiatry, 1978-87 and he interviewed exiled dissidents. Sainsbury 
should have nipped up to north Wales to interview Mary Wynch, me and all
 the other people that his former colleague Dafydd had illegally 
imprisoned during those years.</p>
<p>Sainsbury trained at the Middlesex Hospital just before the creation 
of the NHS and like Ed Miliband’s Uncle Harry (see post ‘Inside 
Information About A Hergest Unit Death’) he remained committed to the 
NHS throughout his life. Sainsbury had a big passion for achitecture and
 gardens and he purchased a sizable piece of land and created a 
extensive landscaped garden and a unique house which were his pride and 
joy. The patients carried on kiling themselves.</p>
<p>The senior registrar on Davies’s team was Michael Shepherd, who ended
 up achieving huge international influence in psychiatry as described in
 my post ‘The Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Connection?’.</p>
<p>Rawnsley had been working in Davies’s Unit for three months&nbsp; 
when he was asked by Aubrey Lewis if he would join the MRC Unit run by 
Lewis. This unit was framed as a ‘social psychiatry research’ unit but 
this is Aubrey Lewis that we are talking about here. Lewis’s work in 
that Unit began by investigating what sort of work was suitable for the 
mentally ill and whether people with what was then called mental 
handicap were capable of learning and whether they could work as well. I
 doubt that Aubrey concerned himself with the niceties of the patients 
gaining fulfilment from that work, it will have been a case of ‘Work 
Will Set You Free’.</p>
<p>Aubrey’s Assistant Director of Auschwitz was Morris Carstairs. 
Carstairs was Professor of Psychological Medicine at Edinburgh 
University, 1961-73 and President of WHO, 1968-72. He was born in the 
Indian Raj and qualified at Edinburgh University in 1949. Carstairs was a
 medical officer in the RAF during World War II and in 1953 was 
appointed senior registrar to Aubrey Lewis at the Maudsley. In 1960 he 
became the head of the new MRC Unit at UCL concerned with psychiatric 
epidemiology. Carstairs relocated to Edinburgh in 1961 and the Unit 
relocated with him. In 1971 he stood down as Director of the Unit.</p>
<p>Between 1973-78 Carstairs was Vice-Chancellor of York University and 
there seems to have been much trouble on his watch. This was a time of 
student protests but Carstairs seemed to have handled things very badly.
 Such was the hostility towards him that not only was he unable to 
expand the University as planned but after he stepped down as VC he was 
unable to return to academia, which suggests that something quite 
cataclysmic happened but I haven’t yet found out what it was.</p>
<p>It seems to have been whilst Carstairs was VC that York University 
spawned a very extreme Conservative students society some of whose 
members were later alleged to have been politicians involved in child 
abuse, including Harvey Proctor and Michael Brown. Christine Hamilton 
was also at York with that crowd.</p>
<p>Laurie Taylor worked at York University with criminologist Stan Cohen
 and it was when they were at York that they carried out their work on 
long term prisoners. Taylor also worked with sex offenders and with John
 McVicar, the former bank robber who became a writer. I’m fairly sure 
that Taylor is friends with Dick Hobbs the criminologist whose 
ethnographic work involved knowing a great deal about serious organised 
crime. Hobbs was mates with the criminologist Jane Morgan, the wife of 
Kenneth Morgan, Labour Party bigwig and former Principal of Aberystwyth 
University whilst Aber was doing a great deal to assist the paedophile 
gang of north Wales including churning out crooked lawyers who advised 
them (see post ‘A Bit More Paleontology’).</p>
<p>Before Taylor worked at York he completed one of his degrees at 
Leicester University – many of whose staff knew about the abuse of kids 
in care in Leicestershire by the paedophile gang which included Frank 
Beck and Greville Janner (see post ‘Radical Leicester And Some Other 
Free Radicals’).</p>
<p>Taylor’s first wife was Anna Coote who was an executive member of the
 NCCL whilst the NCCL was affiliated to PIE. Coote also worked with 
women who had experienced sexual abuse and domestic violence. As I keep 
repeating, it is not possible to do that kind of work and not find out 
about the wrongdoing of the Top Doctors and their associates in social 
work. Coote was Director of the King’s Fund, 1998-2004 and then joined 
the Healthcare Commission ‘to engage patients and the public’. She is 
now head&nbsp; of social policy for the New Economics Foundation.</p>
<p>Laurie Taylor’s third wife was BBC radio producer Cathie Mahon, who 
was a Director of the IPPR, as was Taylor’s son Matthew. In 2005 Matthew
 Taylor was appointed head of No 10’s Policy Unit by Blair. In Oct 2016 
Theresa May appointed Matthew Taylor Chair of the Review of Modern 
Employment, which resulted in the 2017 Taylor Review.</p>
<p>I am wondering whether the notorious high security Carstairs Hospital
 in Scotland, the scene of murders and other grisly deeds, was named 
after Morris Carstairs, although I haven’t found any information about 
that. They are probably both such an embarrassment that they have 
disowned each other.</p>
<p>Lawton Tonge was employed in the concentration camp, as were Jack Tizard, Neil O’Connor, Peter Venables and Jacqueline Grad.</p>
<p>Whilst Rawnsley was at Auschwitz, George Brown was recruited and John Wing arrived in 1957 as Rawnsley left.</p>
<p>Unlike many of these names dropped by Rawnsley, George W. Brown 
completed a substantial body of work. He was a psychologist who came 
from a very much less privileged background than most of his colleagues –
 his father was a lens maker and his mother was a waitress. George Brown
 went to UCL in the early 1950s and studied social sciences. Some years 
after graduation Brown began working in the MRC Unit at the Maudsley and
 whilst there worked on chronic schizophrenia. In the late 1960s Brown 
took up a post at the Social Research Unit at Bedford College, 
University of London and eventually became joint Director. It was here 
that Brown carried out the work for which he became very well known, his
 work on life events and depression. Brown carried out longitudinal 
studies and explored the lives of his patients in detail. He ran a big 
comparative study looking at the life events of people with depression 
in Islington, the Outer Hebrides, Spain and Zimbabwe, the results of 
which he published with Tirril Harris in 1989. So George Brown studied 
the life events of people with depression in Islington throughout the 
70s and 80s. George Brown will have definitely known about the 
paedophile ring that operated in the children’s homes there.</p>
<p>John Wing became Professor John Wing and after his death in 2010 was 
inevitably described as ‘one of the greats of 20th century British and 
World psychiatry’. John Wing studied medicine at UCL in the 1950s as did
 his wife Lorna, who also became a psychiatrist and worked at the 
Maudsley. John Wing was Director of the MRC Unit for 25 years. Various 
people who also became big names in psychiatry worked for John Wing at 
the MRC Unit, including Dinesh Bhugra. Whilst Dinesh Bhugra was 
President of the Royal College he was a Patron of Mark Williams’s Oxford
 Mindfulness Centre, which was based on the research fraud that Mark 
Williams had perpetrated when he worked in Bangor with the paedophiles’ 
friends in the late 1980s (see post ‘The Biggest Expert Of The Lot’).</p>
<p>When Wing retired in 1989 the Royal College of Psychiatrists appointed him as the first Director of the College’s Research Unit.</p>
<p>In 1956 the Wings had a daughter, Susan. Susan was very different to 
other babies but she was three by the time that the Wings realised that 
she had autism and that was only because John Wing happened to attend a 
lecture on autism and recognised his daughter’s symptoms. Years later 
Lorna Wing would explain in interviews that they had not known what was 
wrong with Susan because they hadn’t had any lectures on autism at the 
Maudsley. These were two psychiatrists working at what they all 
maintained was the world’s leading psychiatric hospital in terms of 
research and teaching and they were clueless about their own child. They
 didn’t seen to have done any reading or research themselves regarding 
their daughter’s difficulties and they obviously weren’t offered any 
advice by the global leaders who surrounded them at work.</p>
<p>To her credit, Lorna Wing then devoted much of her time to organising
 support for autistic people because she found that there wasn’t any. 
She also developed an interest in autism – it was Lorna Wing who coined 
the phrase Aspergers Syndrome. However it is clear that with their own 
child the Wings found themselves in the same situation as their patients
 – faced with clueless uninterested doctors who were not going to offer 
any support even in the event of serious disability.</p>
<p>It sums up the Maudsley. I have now read numerous interviews with 
that merry bunch and read some of their work. They spend pages 
emphasising how eminent they all are, how classic their papers are and 
how their work transformed the landscape but the reality was that much 
of their research was flaky, they actually weren’t very good and no-one 
else in medicine took them seriously. A lot of these Top Doctors were 
from privileged backgrounds and what they did excel at was blaming less 
privileged people for their own problems. The differences in lifestyles 
were huge – every interview, every obituary, every light hearted 
anecdote is laden with references to the Top Doctors enjoyment of 
theatre, of opera, of fine wines, of good food and foreign travel, 
whereas the poverty of their seriously ill patients is taken to be a 
personal and moral failing. Furthermore they repeatedly ignored or 
colluded with professionals abusing their positions.</p>
<p>Lorna Wing worked on a dataset called the Camberwell Case Register 
with others from the Maudsley, including Judith Gould. The Camberwell 
Case Register collected heaps of information on all the patients using 
psychiatric services in south London and in 1977 Wing and Gould trawled 
through the data in detail. A lot of those patients will have been the 
victims of the paedophile ring that operated in Lambeth’s children’s 
homes. People at the Maudsley knew about that – particularly a social 
worker at the Maudsley called Tessa Jowell who had also worked as a 
child care officer in Lambeth.</p>
<p>Another person who studied at the knee of John Wing was Terry Brugha 
who was a researcher with the MRC Unit, then a lecturer at the Institute
 of Psychiatry 1980-87.&nbsp; Brugha then took up a post at the 
University of Leicester. Where at that time people in the University of 
Leicester were concealing the appalling abuse of Frank Beck and Greville
 Janner (see post ‘Radical Leicester And Some Other Free Radicals’) and 
the psychiatrist Dr James Earp concealed the wrongdoing of Dafydd et al 
(see post ‘An Expert From England’). Between 1995-97 Brugha was a senior
 medical officer at the Dept of Health in London – just when the 
Waterhouse Tribunal was organised and started. Terry Brugha is now the 
Professor of Psychiatry at Leicester.</p>
<p>Aubrey Lewis had encouraged Rawnsley to go abroad before working in 
Auschwitz. Rawnsley made contact with the Bureau of Applied Social 
Research in Columbia University, the Director of which was Charles 
Glock. As a result, Rawnsley ‘fell in’ with a key figure in the Millbank
 Memorial Fund who ‘gave advice’ to Rawnsley, after which Rawnsley&nbsp;
 ‘worked out a deal’ with Prof Alexander Leighton, from Cornell 
University. As a result Rawnsley took part in epidemiological field work
 that Leighton was carrying out in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Whilst Rawnsley was working in the camp, Archie Cochrane, an 
epidemiologist working in south Wales, visited the Maudsley and offered 
folk at the Maudsley access to ‘his’ communities in south Wales.</p>
<p>Archie Cochrane is known as ‘the father of evidence-based medicine’. 
He went to King’s College Cambridge and qualified from UCL in 1938. 
Cochrane underwent analysis himself under Theodor Reik but became 
disillusioned with analysis. He fought in the Spanish Civil War and was a
 medical officer in the PoW camps in World War II after he was taken 
prisoner himself. Cochrane was appointed to the MRC’s pneumonococciosis 
unit at Llandough Hospital – which later became part of Cardiff Medical 
School – in 1948. He ran randomised controlled trials in Rhondda Fach 
and was the first person to promote the value of such trials.</p>
<p>In 1960 Cochrane became a Prof at the Welsh National School of 
Medicine and in 1969 was appointed Director of the MRC’s Epidemiological
 Research Unit in Cardiff. In 1971 Cochrane co-authored with Walter 
Holland a classic paper on the validation of medical screening 
procedures. In 1971 Cochrane also published a book which was very 
critical of NHS clinicians who fail to carry out randomised controlled 
trials or who did so and then ignored the results.</p>
<p>In 1978 Archie really caused a stir by showing a positive correlation
 between the prevalance of Top Doctors and mortality in younger age 
groups. He also demonstrated that GNP per head was the one variable 
which showed a strong negative association with mortality.</p>
<p>The Archie Cochrane Archive is held at the Archie Cochrane Library at
 Cardiff University. Cochrane is remembered as being a towering figure 
who demonstrated the importance of the fundamentals of good clinical 
science – yet everybody ignores what he said. Interventions are still 
introduced into NHS practice on the flimsiest of evidence without ever 
having been subjected to a randomised controlled trial – vaginal meshes 
anyone? – and medical researchers in the NHS and in pharmaceutical 
companies are past masters at ignoring the results of randomised 
controlled trials if the trials don’t behave themselves and produce the 
desired results. At present the NHS is running a number of screening 
programmes that are at best ineffective and at worst harmful. This is no
 secret, but still kits arrive through people’s letter boxes imploring 
older people to return samples of their turds through the post with the 
threat of death from bowel cancer if they fail to do this and a valiant 
effort is being made to frighten men into Going To The Doctors to be 
screened and then have benign enlarged prostates treated as though they 
are malignant.</p>
<p>One person who ignored everything that Archie Cochrane taught was Kenneth Rawnsley.</p>
<p>Morris Carstairs and George Brown went to south Wales to do the recce
 at Archie’s invitation and a contingent from the Maudsley subsequently 
inflicted themselves upon south Wales. Thus in 1957 a research team in 
Cardiff sprang up consisting of Rawnsley, Joe Loudon, Lewis Miles, Jack 
Ingham and Jim Robinson. All of these people remained obscure except for
 Joe Loudon who became a Professor at Swansea.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aubrey Lewis was the Honorary Director of 
the MRC Unit in south Wales and Rawnsley became the head of the Unit. 
Rawnsley carried out psychiatric morbidity studies in south Wales, which
 compared the mental health of the mining population of the Rhonda Fach 
with the rural population of the Vale of Glamorgan. Rawnsley seems to 
gave drawn some extraordinary conclusions from these studies. Rawnsley 
had a ‘special interest’ in psychosomatic medicine. Such an interest can
 led to insightful sympathetic exploration of patients’ problems&nbsp; 
but I don’t think that it did with Rawnsley. Instead Rawnsley observed 
that people in the mining communities complained a great deal about bad 
backs, about aches and pains and other health problems, whereas people 
in the Vale of Glamorgan didn’t. Thus Rawnsley concluded that the south 
Wales mining communities had different social attitudes to health 
problems that resulted in a higher rate of ‘psychiatric problems’ than 
among the population of the Vale of Glamorgan. It clearly had nothing to
 do with the poverty and poor living conditions in the Rhondda or the 
people being employed in one of the most dangerous industries in the UK.
 It was just that lot bellyaching about imagined aches and pains.</p>
<p>Rawnsley also showed his sensitive side in 1961 when he worked with a
 community of people from Tristan da Cuna who had been evacuated to 
Calshot near Southampton after the volcanic eruption. The Tristans were 
an example of an isolated community – there had been no inward migration
 into the community for generations, so the MRC studied them ‘from all 
angles’ when they arrived in England. Rawnsley later commented that the 
Tristans were very co-operative with his research but that was because 
their experiences of the other MRC researchers had been so bad. One 
person working for the MRC had ‘insisted on photographing them naked 
against a scale for their physical anthropometry – a terrible thing to 
do they said’.</p>
<p>Ken didn’t measure the Tristans naked, he studied the prevalence of 
‘hysteria’ among them by comparing their hysterical symptoms with the 
information documented from a Norwegian study 25 years previously. Ken’s
 conclusion re the Tristans? They displayed ‘a powerful example of the 
pathogenic and pathoplastic nature of social factors in neurosis’, 
provided an example of a ‘grand hysterie’ and ‘it was the wives of the 
leaders who had a hypersensitivity to neurosis which raised the question
 of assortative mating of leaders with neurotic women, or whether being 
married to a leader is pathogenic’.</p>
<p>Ken might as well have measured them naked.</p>
<p>Ken remembered that the Tristans ‘didn’t like it at Calshot’ and they ‘went home’.</p>
<p>John Wing became head of the MRC Unit when Rawnsley was appointed to 
the first Chair of Psychological Medicine at the Welsh National School 
of Medicine (Cardiff Medical School) in 1964, Rawnsley being a man with a
 nuanced understanding of the problems of the people of south Wales 
particularly those bastards in the Rhondda who never stopped moaning. In
 1966 Rawnsley heard no no end of their whinging when the coal tip fell 
on that school in Aberfan and killed loads of them.</p>
<p>Ken’s colleague Jack Ingham continued the work of the MRC Unit in 
Edinburgh with Norman Kreitman and Joe Loudon went to work in Swansea 
University’s Dept of Sociology and Anthropology – the Swansea University
 that was pretty much run by Rhodri Morgan’s family (see post ‘A Bit 
More Paleontology’). Lewis Miles popped up to Anglesey to carry out a 
prevalence study – where Miles could not have failed to have noticed the
 abuse of kids in care up there and the incarceration of awkward 
customers in the North Wales Hospital Denbigh, by which time Ken’s old 
mate Dafydd had finished his training at the Maudsley and was doing 
whatever he wanted at Denbigh.</p>
<p>Somebody apart from Enoch Powell must have noticed what Dafydd and 
Gwynne the lobotomist were doing because part of Ken’s remit as Prof at 
Cardiff was to improve psychiatric services across Wales. Ken felt 
‘greatly supported at all times by the psychiatric community in Wales’ 
so Ken’s demands were obviously not too onerous.</p>
<p>The Welsh Hospital Board – which ran the North Wales Hospital whilst 
Dafydd and Gwynne lobotomised, shocked, incarcerated and shagged within 
its walls – appointed Ken as an advisor in psychiatry for Wales. This 
involved Ken having extensive discussions with the Welsh Hospital Board 
regarding the planning of psychiatric services for Wales. So there was 
actually a plan behind what Dafydd and Gwynne were doing…</p>
<p>The official story of Ken’s time as Professor at Cardiff was that he 
‘established a vigorous and widely based academic unit closely 
integrated with the psychiatric services of South Glamorgan, with a 
special teaching and research unit at Whitchurch Mental Hospital. This 
last link enabled him to inject new strength into the scientific 
investigation which had flourished there since the early years of its 
history as an asylum’.</p>
<p>We are told that Ken ‘showed imaginative foresight in the integration
 of clinical practice, teaching and research, in the main hospital and 
local mental hospital’.</p>
<p>Whitchutch Hospital had a terrible reputation until it’s closure in 
2016. Pre-Ken it had&nbsp; been the domain of Linford Rees and his porn 
pics and Welsh cakes (see post ‘A Galaxy of Talent’). Whitchurch’s claim
 to fame was as the institution administering the highest rate of ECT in
 Europe. Tony Francis (Dr X) trained at Ken’s glorious dept in Cardiff 
and Chris Hunter – whom Francis enlisted in his attempts to bang me up 
in a high security unit when I didn’t even know that Chris Hunter 
existed (see post ‘The Night of the (Dr Chris) Hunter’) – worked at 
Whitchurch Hospital. My friend from the&nbsp;sixth form went to Cardiff 
to do medicine whilst Ken was Chair of that department and she told me 
at the time that the students all hated their psychiatry ‘block’ and 
after having experienced that taster none of them wanted to go into 
psychiatry. I remember my friend telling me that the male medical 
students used to be propositioned by the female patients. I wonder where
 the patients might have got the idea that sex between patients and 
staff might be a good idea from?</p>
<p>In 1991 Robin Jacobson of St George’s Hospital Medical 
School/Springfield Hospital documented that Dafydd and Tony Francis had 
‘lost their boundaries’ after Dafydd told Jacobson that I was 
‘attractive and seductive’ and that he and Tony Francis ‘had a soft spot
 for me’. Francis was trying to have me imprisoned&nbsp; at the time 
on&nbsp; the basis of the perjury of him and his wife Sadie, who also 
worked as a psychiatrist at Ysbyty Gwynedd and had previously worked at 
Denbigh.</p>
<p>Now here’s another mystery. Sadie worked as a clinical assistant at 
Denbigh. No doctor ever wants a job as a clinical assistant because it 
is categorised as a non-career post and one can’t gain promotion to a 
consultant. I’m fairly sure that this is, or at that time was, enshrined
 in NHS regulations. Yet after her spell as a clinical assistant at 
Denbigh, Sadie rocked up at Ysbyty Gwynedd as a consultant. Another 
clinical assistant, the disastrous Quasim Ijaz (see post ‘Update On The 
Inquest Of Michael Capper – And A Bit Of History’) was also given a job 
as a consultant psychiatrist at Ysbyty Gwynedd after working as a 
clinical assistant. He was given Tony Francis’s job after Francis took 
early retirement and the North West Wales NHS Trust advertised the 
vacancy three times and received no applications.</p>
<p>Ken was closely involved with&nbsp; Royal College of Psychiatrists 
from its creation in 1971 – in 1972 he was elected the first Dean of the
 College.</p>
<p>Ken waxed lyrical about the establishment of the Royal College in his
 interview with Brian Barraclough and remembered that the London College
 of Physicians opposed the idea of a Royal College of Psychiatrists and 
wanted a Faculty of Psychiatry within the Royal College of Physicians. 
The Royal College of Surgeons just saw it as an irrelevance.</p>
<p>The Privy Council was involved with the establishment of the Royal 
College of Psychiatrists and a key figure in the negotiations was Ben 
Munro, the Secretary of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association</p>
<p>Dr David Owen’s old mate the unhinged and lethal William Sargant (see
 post ‘Dr Death’) had been the Registrar of the RMPA for years and Munro
 had been the Secretary. Martin Cuthbert had been the last President of 
the RMPA, but Martin Roth was elected as the first President of the 
Royal College. Ken intriguingly reminded Brian Barraclough that if the 
officers had not been elected by the membership, Roth would never have 
become President.</p>
<p>From the beginning there had been quarrels over the membership exam 
and the aggro was such that one person who had been involved with the 
RMPA at a senior level for years resigned. There was an agreement that 
psychiatrists already working in the system wouldn’t have to take the 
Royal College’s exam – so that’ll be how Dafydd clocked up his 
credentials. The acquisition of the Royal College’s palatial building in
 Belgrave Square left the Treasurer of the Royal College concerned that 
the Royal College would go bankrupt.</p>
<p>It was Sir Martin Roth who raised the funding for 17, Belgrave Square
 and he raised the money from a most unlikely source&nbsp; – a loan on 
favourable terms from Marks &amp; Spencer (see post ‘The 
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Connection?’). I am mystified as to why Marks &amp; 
Spencer were happy to bankroll this bunch of conmen – there will have 
been skulduggery somewhere. Ken mentions that Roth had to ‘go it alone’ 
where raising the dosh for No 17 was concerned and that Roth also held 
‘the long drawn out dialogue with the Department of Health’ that was 
involved when the Royal College was established. Ken does not reveal 
what the long drawn out dialogue was about but presumably it was held 
with Heath’s Health Secretary, Sir Keith Joseph.</p>
<p>I note that the Royal College is no longer located in the Belgrave 
Square building with which they were so delighted but could not afford.</p>
<p>NHS funding from the DHSS paid for the College to inspect psychiatry 
training programmes in order to raise standards – so there was obviously
 some considerable concern in the DHSS about standards.</p>
<p>Ken ‘played a major role in creating the system&nbsp; for inspection 
and approval of the quality of clinical and educational facilities in 
psychiatric hospitals’. So it was the system created by Ken that deemed 
Dafydd’s ‘therapeutic community’ in the underground chamber at Denbigh 
acceptable, as well as Dafydd’s training facilities which included 
Dafydd’s office – to which trainee female clinical psychologists from 
Bangor University were invited to ‘talk about psychology’. Once they had
 arrived Dafydd would show them ancient photos of himself and ask ‘Don’t
 ewe think I was handsome?’. (No Dafydd, the person who told me about 
this just concluded that you were nuts.)</p>
<p>Ken needed the regional Health Authorities to realise that their 
clinical standards had to be raised or junior doctors wouldn’t apply for
 posts – ‘there were appeals, objections and protests’. Nonetheless ‘the
 great majority of the hospitals were approved’. Including Denbigh. I 
presume that there was simply no failing Ken’s rigorous criteria.</p>
<p>In the early years of the College, Ken noted that peripheral 
hospitals feared that they would lose all their staff to academic 
centres. It was quite clear to me that nearly every junior doctor 
working in psychiatry in Ysbyty Gwynedd and Denbigh in the mid-late 
1980s was just about unemployable. The situation will have been just as 
bad before then and because everybody – including Ken – lied about 
standards having been raised, standards remained dangerous and patients 
died. All that anybody&nbsp; needed to have done was to stop Dafydd 
illegally imprisoning people, keeping them in&nbsp; a cellar and 
sexually exploiting them but no-one could even do that.</p>
<p>Ken was President of the Royal College, 1981-84 and was elected to succeed Desmond Pond.</p>
<p>In his interview with Brian Barraclough, Ken tells Barraclough that 
during his term of office, the Mental Health Act was put forward first 
in the Lords and later in the Commons. Ken explained that the Gov’t – 
which will have been Thatcher ‘s Gov’t – set up&nbsp; a special 
committee to evaluate and modify the Bill where required.</p>
<p>Ken and ‘senior officers’ from the Royal College ‘devoted much time 
and energy in briefing and educating Peers’. They also gave oral and 
written evidence before the Commons Committee and ‘succeeded in securing
 the elimination of the more extreme constraints on clinical freedom’. 
In other words Rawnsley and chums argued down the measures that 
concerned MPs had tried to add to the Bill in order to protect patients 
from the Dafydds of this world. By the time that Ken had ensured that 
there was bugger all protection for patients in the Bill, Mary Wynch 
had&nbsp; begun litigation after being wrongfully arrested and 
imprisoned for a year by Dafydd (see post ‘The Mary Wynch Case – 
Details’). Rawnsley knew about this case as did the rest of the officers
 of the College who argued the toss with the Commons Committee. Someone 
else knew about the case as well – Professor Robert Bluglass, who wrote 
the Mental Health Act. Some six years later when appointed to 
investigate my own complaint, Bluglass covered for Dafydd when Dafydd 
had illegally had me arrested and imprisoned and completely ignored the 
fact that three months before Dafydd did that, Tony Francis and Jackie 
Brandt had unlawfully detained me at Ysbyty Gwynedd (see post ‘Enter 
Professor Robert Bluglass CBE’). The person who drafted the Code of 
Practice to accompany the Act was William Bingley, the Legal Director of
 MIND who had been covering up for Dafydd for years, as had his mother 
Lady Juliet Bingley when she was Chair of MIND. Bingley continued 
colluding with and concealing Dafydd’s criminality when he later became 
Chief Exec of the Mental Health Act Commission.Ken complained to 
Barraclough that ‘they were struggling against a powerful anti-medicine,
 anti-scientific prejudice in society and much loud and thoughtless 
clamour from civil liberties lobbies’. There was the matter of some 
madmen in north Wales who were unlawfully having people arrested, 
keeping them in a cellar, having sex with them, drugging them, running a
 paedophile ring and trafficking female patients into prostitution. 
Neither were Ken and co accepted as scientists by other branches of 
medicine – one only went to work for Ken or Dafydd if one’s copy book 
was blotted so badly that there was no hope left.</p>
<p>At a late stage in the Bill, a Comons member moved an amendment that 
certain treatments such as psychosurgery had to be subject to a second 
opinion from the Mental Health Act Commission even if the patient was 
not liable to be detained. This amendment was accepted by Ken Clarke – 
the Minister who had set up&nbsp; the Committee to examine the Bill, 
under Norman Fowler the Secretary of State for Health – to the 
‘amazement’ of Clarke’s advisors. Ken Rawnsley considered this to be a 
‘major setback’.</p>
<p>So Rawnsley considered it most unreasonable that he – or indeed 
Dafydd – were not to be permitted to recommend a lobotomy for a patient 
who wasn’t considered sectionable without seeking a second opinion from 
their partners in crime on the Mental Health Act Commission. Ken 
observed to Barraclough that in Scotland there are no such restrictions 
on psychosurgery. There have also been some very great abuses of mental 
health patients in Scotland and those abuses continue today.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why Ken was so vexed regarding the constraints placed 
upon the Top Doctors – after all Dafydd and co simply just breached 
every aspect of this most unreasonable Mental Health Act when it was 
passed and they didn’t even receive a written warning. Not even from the
 man who had written the Act. I doubt that Ken et al ever did find that 
they were limited even with regard to psychosurgery.</p>
<p>Cardiff is one of the last remaining centres for psychosurgery in 
England and Wales – although there is no guarantee that Dafydd isn’t 
busy in his kitchen with a pick, it’s not as if anybody would stop him. 
Lena Zavaroni died after psychosurgery at Cardiff and the truth was not 
told about the circumstances of that death.</p>
<p>Rawnsley mentioned that the Royal College had asked for the creation 
of the Mental Health Act Commission to improve safeguards before 
detaining patients. So that job creation scheme for William Bingley, 
Chris Heginbotham, Louis Blom-Cooper, Tessa Jowell and Lord Kamlash 
Patel worked brilliantly didn’t it.</p>
<p>Ken stated that the ‘powerful anti-psychiatry feeling’ that he 
believed existed among MPs was fuelled by scandals in mental hospitals. 
Obviously Ken being a paid up member of one of the galaxies of talent 
meant that he occupied a different galaxy to me, but in Galaxy Baker 
what I noticed was MPs colluding with Top Doctors to keep the huge 
scandal which was Dafydd completely under wraps because of Dafydd’s role
 in supplying children to paedophiles in politics, including Ken 
Clarke’s and Norman Fowler ‘s colleague Sir Peter Morrison.</p>
<p>Barraclough responded to Rawnsley’s mention of scandals in the 
interview by reminding Rawnsley that of course those scandals were a 
result of underfunding. Well once these dangerous idiots have received 
their salaries and pension pots and had their research units bankrolled,
 once an inspection system has been set up that allows Dafydd to 
imprison abducted people in the cellar and once no legal expense has 
been spared to pursue anyone who dares complain through the criminal 
justice system and into the prisons and high security hospitals, there’s
 not going to be much left over to waste on patient care. And Bluglass 
will want a good lunch and a nice hotel for the night when he goes up to
 north Wales to conduct the cover-up and then there’s the millions 
needed for the rigged Public Inquiries when somebody dies…</p>
<p>Ken noted that when he became President of the Royal College, Cardiff
 Medical School and the Health Authority were delighted because it 
brought kudos to psychiatry in Cardiff and Wales. Just when Mary Wynch 
got out of Denbigh and began her litigation against Dafydd. Tony Francis
 arrived as a consultant in north Wales just after Ken became President –
 a nice young doctor who’d been at university with Kinnock who became 
leader of the Labour Party soon afterwards. A nice young doctor who was 
going to lead psychiatry in north Wales into a new dawn – who was sadly 
as dangerous and as unhinged as Dafydd, but who was a great deal more 
plausible.</p>
<p>Ken was also the College’s rep on the Central Distinction Awards 
Committee, so he oversaw the consultants bonus’s, the ‘merit awards’ – 
one did not&nbsp; have to be meritorious to receive one of those. Ken 
himself pointed out that there needed to be a system which rewarded Top 
Doctors who didn’t have lots of publications and who didn’t work in 
academic centres but who provided a service to the community. Perhaps by
 keeping the victims of sex offenders in a cellar.</p>
<p>Anyone for an extra Welsh cake?</p>
<p>Rawnsley remembered the political battles between the DHSS, the BMA 
and the Royal College. They all loathed each other but were united in 
concealing the criminality of Dafydd and the paedophiles…</p>
<p>Rawnsley mentioned in his interview with Barraclough that the 
President of the Royal College is a member of the Joint Consultants 
Committee. It was that Committee who appointed Bluglass and Colin Berry 
to investigate my complaint about Dafydd and the paedophiles’ friends – 
safe in the knowledge that Bluglass was a colleague and friend of at 
least two former colleagues of Francis and Dafydd. Bluglass performed 
the cover-up in the summer of 1988 and had been appointed by very early 
in 1988 – so the Committee will have been working out how to get Dafydd 
and Tony Francis off the hook at the end&nbsp; of 1987. When the 
President of the College was – Dr Jim Birley, who starred in my post ‘A 
Galaxy of Talent’.</p>
<p>Jim Birley had worked at the Maudsley with Dafydd’s mate Bob Hobson 
and I bet that he knew Dafydd as well. Birley also knew David Ennals, 
the Gov’t Minister and Chair of MIND when MIND had links with PIE. For 
more details of Jim including his psychotic breakdown from which he of 
course recovered overnight and was never troubled by again, please see 
post ‘A Galaxy Of Talent’.</p>
<p>The hearing into my complaint was originally sheduled for March 1988.
 The investigation was being co-ordinated by the Welsh Office’s Medical 
Ombudsman Professor Robert Owen, a surgeon from Liverpool University who
 was as corrupt as everybody else involved. Last year my lawyer 
forwarded me documentation related to the hearing that I had not 
previously seen. Robert Owen was receiving letters and phone calls about
 me from the corrupt GP David Wood, who had been the person who had 
originally referred me to Gwynne the lobotomist and then to Tony Francis
 and who had been the first person to threaten me with damage to my 
career if I complained about the lobotomist. Because of the constant 
unpleasantness from Wood, by 1988 he was no longer my GP. Yet I had not 
named Wood in my complaint, so there was no reason for him to be 
comunicating with Owen about my complaint concerning Francis and Dafydd.
 Furthermore Wood had contacted Owen at his home in Colwyn Bay offering 
him ‘information’ about me. So keen was Wood to impart this unspecified 
‘information’ that Wood had cleared his diary and put aside an afternoon
 when he would make himself available to Owen, who was going to ring 
Wood from home.</p>
<p>I knew nothing about any of this until last year.</p>
<p>On the arranged date in March 1988 I arrived for the hearing into my 
complaint. I arrived to find no-one there but a very friendly Prof Owen,
 full of apologies and explaining that the hearing had been post-poned 
at the last minute because someone had been taken ill. I am absolutely 
sure that Prof Owen told me that it was Dafydd who had been taken ill 
because I remember thinking Christ they’ve done everything possible not 
to investigate this complaint and now Dafydd’s thrown a sickie. I also 
joked about it in a letter to Gwynedd Health Authority.</p>
<p>The hearing finally took place in July. Dafydd lied through his 
teeth, written and oral evidence given by staff from the North Wales 
Hospital confirmed that Dafydd had broken the law, done a deal with a 
corrupt senior police officer in Bangor Police Station to have me 
arrested and both nurses and another consultant had told Dafydd that 
what he was doing was illegal. He ignored them and stated that I ‘must 
not be allowed to go free’. No part of my complaint about Tony Francis 
and Jackie Brandt was investigated and neither was my complaint about 
Stephen Rose, a Denbigh nurse who assaulted me.</p>
<p>Bluglass concluded that the Top Doctors facilitating a gang of 
paedophiles who had done all this were ‘caring people’ who had been 
‘harassed’ by me and that I had caused many people great annoyance and 
upset. Dafydd later told people that Bluglass had stated that I was 
probably a psychopath who would end up in a ward for the criminally 
insane. Dafydd remarked that it was a chilling prediction. Those two 
were obviously writing their own Gothic horror story – another from the 
pen of Dafydd Alun Poe…</p>
<p>In 1991 Bluglass told Dr Robin Jacobson of St George’s that I had a 
homicidal capacity. Not that I’d ever killed anyone, but Old Bluglass’s 
Almanac was obviously being called upon.</p>
<p>Bluglass made a point in his report of noting that so crazed and 
vindictive towards poor old Dafydd was I that I had even accused Dafydd 
of going off sick on the day of the first scheduled hearing, when 
actually it had been Bluglass who had been rushed into hospital.</p>
<p>Perhaps my memory is playing tricks, but one thing that is crystal clear is that this lot were a bunch of liars and cheats.</p>
<p>In Nov 1987 at about the time when Bluglass would have been appointed
 to conduct the cover-up, Alison Taylor, the Gwynedd social worker who 
blew the whistle on the abuse of children in care in north Wales, was 
sacked. Alison’s boss, the Director of Gwynedd Social Services Lucille 
Hughes, was Dafydd’s mistress. Lucille was named in the Waterhouse 
Report as knowing that a paedophile ring was operating within the social
 services but failed to act.</p>
<p>On Feb 28 1988 Alison wrote to the Secretary of State for the DHSS 
Tony Newton and told him about a vicious assault she had witnessed on a 
child. That letter would have been received about two weeks before I 
turned up for the big day only to find that either Dafydd or Bluglass 
had suddenly been taken ill.</p>
<p>The cover-up was rescheduled for July.</p>
<p>During May and June the Nottingham Satanic Panic took place, which, 
like the Cleveland Child Abuse Scandal, resulted in ludicrous 
allegations being made about innocent people by social workers at a time
 when across the UK evidence was emerging that the nation’s social 
services had been infiltrated by organised paedophile gangs. Like 
Cleveland, the Nottingham Satanic Panic provided a useful distraction 
from the allegations that Alison, Mary and me were making that something
 terrible was happening in north Wales (see post ‘Twas The Night Before 
Christmas And The Culprits Were Named’).</p>
<p>The notion of Satanic Abuse was first introduced into the UK by a 
therapist/social worker based in north Wales who travelled the UK 
providing ‘training’ to others as to how to spot signs of Satanic Abuse.</p>
<p>At least two people with learning disabilities were banged up in Denbigh as a result of allegations of Satanic Abuse.</p>
<p>In July 1988 Elizabeth Butler-Sloss published her Report on the 
Cleveland Child Abuse Scandal. Butler-Sloss was the sister of Michael 
Havers, Attorney General, 1979-87. In his capacity as Attorney General 
Havers blocked the prosecution of former diplomat and Deputy Head of MI6
 Sir Peter Hayman for child porn offences – Hayman was a member of PIE.</p>
<p>In July 1988 Robert Bluglass wrote his report in which he maintained that the only real problem in north Wales was me.</p>
<p>At some point in 1988 Gordon Anglesea became a Superintendent in the 
North Wales Police stationed in Colwyn Bay. Anglesea lived in Colwyn 
Bay, as did the Chief Constable of North Wales who led the force whilst 
it concealed child abuse.</p>
<p>Anglesea had previously been stationed in Wrexham and in 1994 won 
nearly 400k damages after bringing a libel case in the wake of two young
 men alleging that Anglesea had abused them when they had been in care 
in Wrexham (see post ‘Y Gwir Yn Erbyn Y Byd’). One of the men, Mark 
Humphreys, was found dead weeks later.</p>
<p>In 2016 Gordon Anglesea was imprisoned for historic sex offences against boys in care in Wrexham.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rawnsley’s wife Elinor Kapp is also a Top Doctor. She spent her 
career as a child psychiatrist in Gwent and Powys. In 2010 Kapp wrote to
 The Times in her capacity as a child psychiatrist with regard to 
paedophile priests. Kapp stated that ‘within the children’s professions 
by that time we all knew that the majority of abusers would manipulate 
in whatever way they could to deny their wrongdoing and continue their 
bahaviour. It was also made clear that all cases known to professionals 
must be reported to the authorities, to avoid exactly the collusion that
 typically appears to continue to operate in the Roman Catholic Church’.</p>
<p>In a response to a discussion about this matter on the blog 
‘Dolphinarium’, following her letter to The Times, Kapp explained that 
in the 1970s and 80s she was working as a child psychiatrist outside 
London and that she and her colleagues worked increasingly closely with 
the police and social services, steadily learning more about the 
problems of identifying and dealing with cases of child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>At present Elinor Kapp is a member of the Board of the City Hospice 
in south Wales – she has been involved with the hospice as both a Board 
member and volunteer since its foundation. The City Hospice was 
originally known as the George Thomas Trust, after the south Wales 
Labour MP and Speaker of the House who was involved with the Trust. The 
Trust changed its name after it was admitted that there had been 
repeated allegations that George Thomas had abused children and teenaged
 boys but that the police failed to act and Thomas was protected by a 
network of people in politics and the professions.</p>
<p>Elinor’s biography on the City Hospice website explains that she is a ‘mother and a grandmother’ with ‘a kind heart’.</p>
