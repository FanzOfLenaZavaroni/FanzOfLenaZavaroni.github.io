### Lyrics
> Sitting alone on a cold bar stool
>Your cold, hard eyes make me feel a fool
>Pastel white features, high cheek-bones
>Scarlet-blooded lips and deathly tones
>The girl of my nightmares
>Sultry and corpse-like
>The girl of my nightmares.
>
> Brittle fingers and thin cigarettes
> So hard to tell apart
> She hasn't spoken yet
> You put your hand on mine
> Death white on brown
> Those whirlpool eyes
> Well I begin to drown
> The girl of my nightmares
> Erotic and skullfaced
> The girl of my nightmares.
>
> Anorexic beauty
> Featherweight perfection
> Anorexic beauty
> Underweight goddess.
>
> Sitting alone on a cold bar stool
> you're so hard to tell apart
> She hasn't spoken yet
> Pastel white features, high cheekbones
> Scarlet-blooded lips and deathly tones
> The girl of my nightmares
> Sultry and corpse-like
> The girl of my nightmares.
>
> Anorexic beauty
> Featherweight perfection
> Anorexic beauty
> Underweight goddess.

### Dedicated
Pulp dedicated Track No: 7 - Anorexic Beauty to Lena Zavaroni.

### Details
> It wasn’t originally a Pulp song. Written by David Kurley of early-Pulp contemporaries New Model Soldier, it was sold to Russell for £1 after a gig. The song dates back to an earlier David Kurley band, Blimp, who featured a young Magnus Doyle on drums.

### My Personal View On The Track
> I believe the song aims to point out the contradictory feelings we have towards a person with anorexia we may love and or find the individual beautiful while finding the way they look horrific. This leads to a conflict of feelings.
>
> It is sad to note that some Pro-Anorexia websites use the song to justify anorexia as a lifestyle chose, when in fact it's a physiological response to a mental health issue and also shows that the creates of such websites have missed the point of the song.
