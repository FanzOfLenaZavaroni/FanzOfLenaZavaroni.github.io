# Latest news, updates & changes related to the Fanz of Lena Zavaroni website.

* The about and Introduction pages were combined into one page to make room for the updates link in the menu so that I would not have to resize the menu section.
* Over the coming months I will be removing links to the IMDb because of the fact that they have shown that they are not bothered about providing the correct titles for TV programmes and have not even given a reason as to why they think it is alright to use programme titles that are not the title of the TV Programme [[Details Here]](https://github.com/FanzOfLenaZavaroni/fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/issues/12#issuecomment-536528451) and so I am unwilling to promote the website by linking to its content.
* The reason why it will take months is because this website is created and updated by just one individual and so anything added, removed or updated takes time.
* That is why content tends to be added, updated shortly before it is due to be shown as an on this day.
