* The about and Introduction pages were combined into one page to make room for the updates link in the menu so that I would not have to resize the menu section.
* Over the coming months I will be removing links to the IMDb because of the fact that they have shown that they are not bothered about providing the correct titles for TV programmes and have not even given a reason as to why they think it is alright to use programme titles that are not the title of the TV Programme [[Details Here]](https://github.com/FanzOfLenaZavaroni/fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/issues/12#issuecomment-536528451) and so I am unwilling to promote the website by linking to its content.
* The reason why it will take months is because this website is created and updated by just one individual and so anything added, removed or updated takes time.
* This is why content tends to be added, updated shortly before it is due to be shown as an on this day.
* Content may also get added/updated if it comes up for debate in the comment section of a page an example of this is when I was asked about Crackerjack and The Swap Shop Star Awards Show which I replied to and added the details I had on the two programmes to the website instead of waiting until they would have come up in the On This Day section. By adding/updating content when it is due in the On This Day section or when debated in the comment section gives me time to add details and over time should insure that all known details gets added and is kept up-to-date.
* Today I received an email from NewsBank Email Updates which shows media content for 4 News Stores that mention Lena Zavaroni. If visitors wish me to post the links here let me know, but NOTE you will need to login to the NewsBank to see the content which is why I have not just added the links. The way I login is to use my Library Card Number you may be able to do the same if you are a Library Member and your Library is part of the scheme that lets you log into NewsBank as well as NewsBank I can use my Library Card Number to log into The Times archive so if you have a Library Card it is worth you checking out what website you can get free access to via your Library Card Number unrelated but you may be able to get access to free e-books and audiobooks as well.
