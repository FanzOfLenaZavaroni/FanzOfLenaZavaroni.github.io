5 October 2020 - Just started this list so hopefully it will grow over the next days, weeks, ECT.

The following is a list of websites and tips that may help you with your own research due to my policy on watermarking and due to trolling some well known websites will not be on this list, but as the best research is done yourself this will not matter this is just to help push you in the right direction and is far from an exhaustive list.

### Notes
* ——: While I don't like watermarking if the website has not broken copyright law by the use of watermarking then it may get a link.
* ——: As you will find stockphoto websites don't seem to understand the importance of providing details on the photos or putting them into context which is a great shame and where dates and/or details are given you can't take the info at face value and will need to do addtional research to confirm what is given is correct.
* ——: An addition of a website to this page is not an endorsement of that website and is just here for anyone looking for a starting place to research Lena Zavaroni.

* ——: [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=Lena%20Zavaroni) by selecting different Search options: metadata, text contents, TV news captions, radio transcripts or archived web sites the content you get will change.
* ——: [Internet Archive: Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) lets you view old or deleted websites by typing in the URL of a website not all websites will have been archive and the archives may be limited to the text but for research the text will be of more value than any out of context image.
   * ——: **Note:** some pages may seem to be blank but if you press control and A or what the combination of keyboad keys is for your OS to select all you will then see the text. The reason for this is that the orignal website had a background image with white text but the Wayback Machine has not archive the background image and so the page has ended up with white text on a white background. [example](https://web.archive.org/web/20140410193639/http://www.cchr-london.org/lena-zavaroni/) looks blank but if you select all you can see the text.
