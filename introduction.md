> We can never know the true story of Lena Zavaroni's life as it seems to be a closed subject.
>
> The best we can do is try and build up a view based on the information provided by the media and the public comments made by Lena, her family and friends.
>
> So this is why it's not a biography but a fan's attempt to discover what he can about the life and death of an individual that died way to young and for no real reason.
>
> It is presented as a series of short notes and comments along with links to related media, blogs, etc.
>
> I hope fans will find it of interest and that it helps them on their own discovery of Lena Zavaroni.
>
> It's a hard but sometimes happy but also very sad journey into the world of Lena Zavaroni.
>
> If you want the fantasy Lena that some fans seem to then you should end your journey here.
