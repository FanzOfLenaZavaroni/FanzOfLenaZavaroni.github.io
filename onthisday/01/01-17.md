**17 January 2007**
* [<span id="age1"></span> years ago the Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland) report on the fact that Lena's Cousin stabbed her lover to death.](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/LENA+COUSIN+STABBED+HER+LOVER+TO+DEATH%3b+She+admits+lashing+out+during...-a0157732047)
   * At the time the media did not report the fact that she was a victim of abuse by Allan Osbourne, the man she stabbed to death.
   * It may have been that details of the abuse was not known at this time.

**Note**
I realise some fans may question what this has to do with our story of Lena Zavaroni but as the headline in the Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland) was:
> LENA COUSIN STABBED HER LOVER TO DEATH; She admits lashing out during row.

This website can't ignore the refereance to Lena even though very small and an event not even related to Lena Zavaroni.
