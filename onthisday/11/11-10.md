**10 November 1980:**
<span id="age1"></span> years ago Lena Zavaroni stars in her own show at the Double Diamond, Caerphilly for one week.
* **Note:** I have unpublished the article for The Lena Zavaroni Show at the Double Diamond, Caerphilly as I can not confirm the dates or if Lena even appeared at the Diamond Theatre as it was renamed in 1980.

<!-- Script for calculating number of years ago -->
<script>
var dob = '19801110';
var year = Number(dob.substr(0, 4));
var month = Number(dob.substr(4, 2)) - 1;
var day = Number(dob.substr(6, 2));
var today = new Date();
var age1 = today.getFullYear() - year;
if (today.getMonth() < month || (today.getMonth() == month && today.getDate() < day)) {
age1--;
}
document.getElementById("age1").innerHTML=age1;
</script>
